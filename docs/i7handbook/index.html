<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>Somebody once said that if you ask five poets to define poetry,
you’ll get seven definitions. I’m sure I’m misquoting wildly &ndash; the
original version may not have been about poetry at all &ndash; but the point
should be clear. There are undoubtedly more good ways to explain the
intricacies of the Inform 7 programming language than there are people
who have written tutorials on the subject.</p>

<p>This book makes no claim to being the ultimate guide to Inform 7. On
the contrary: A number of topics that experienced Inform authors (or new
authors who envision unusual types of gameplay) may want or need to know
about simply aren’t included in <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em>, or are
mentioned only in passing. The purpose of this book is to give
first-time authors the kind of information and insight that they’ll need
in order to start using Inform 7 to produce parser-based interactive
fiction in its most familiar form, without getting tangled up in a lot
of complexities. (If you don’t know what I mean by “parser-based,” keep
reading.) This version of the <em>Handbook</em> is current with respect
to version 6L38 of Inform 7, and may not be accurate with respect to
older or more recent versions.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to organize the material in ways that will help newcomers
find useful information quickly. I’ve attempted, as well, to write in a
way that makes few or no assumptions about what the reader already
knows. If you read the <em>Handbook</em> page by page from start to
finish, you’ll spot a few repetitions; I felt that some minor redundancy
would be better than forcing readers to hunt for information.</p>

<p>Inform 7 (“I7” for short) comes bundled with two long and detailed
tutorial/reference books, <a href="../WI_1.html"><em>Writing with Inform</em></a> and <a href="../RB_1.html"><em>The
Inform Recipe Book</em></a>, which can be found under the Documentation
tab in the Inform application. The online versions are of limited
use if you have the Inform application open, but they can be very handy
if you find yourself wanting to brush up on your Inform by reading on
your phone while riding on a train. Before getting too far along in the
process of writing a game, every Inform author should read the
Documentation! Several times, in fact. That’s the best way to get
familiar with the power of Inform.</p>

<p>Some aspiring authors, however, find the Documentation a bit
daunting. At times the Documentation seems to assume that a gentle nudge
in the right direction will be all that readers will need. Step-by-step
instructions, cross-references, and full discussions of the myriad
details that authors may need to have at their fingertips are not always
provided. Clearly, there’s room for a different approach.</p>

<p><em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> grew out of my experiences teaching
younger students (ages 10 through 15) to write interactive fiction using
Inform 7. When beginning students asked me how to do the kinds of things
that beginning authors naturally want to do, I sometimes found that the
information they needed was scattered through the Documentation, making
it hard to find and hard to put together into a clear mental picture.
Figuring out how to do some of the most basic real-world programming
chores strictly by reading the Documentation may take a bit of study.
I’ve heard comments about this from adult newcomers as well.</p>

<p>In <em>The Inform 7 Handbook,</em> information is organized into
chapters by task. Chapter 2 is about making rooms, Chapter 5 tells how
to create characters, Chapter 6 has ideas for designing puzzles, and so
on. None of the chapters is intended to tell you absolutely everything
about a given topic that you might want or need to know; after (or
while) reading a section of the <em>Handbook</em>, you’ll often want to
refer back the Documentation. I’ve included cross-references in many
places to show what pages you should consult.</p>

<p>Inform 7 is not the only programming language available for writing
interactive fiction. Its main competition (if free software can be said
to compete) comes from <a href="http://www.tads.org/">TADS 3</a>. Version 3 of TADS (The Adventure
Development System) is, in some ways, more sophisticated than Inform 7,
and Eric Eve’s marvelous alternate library for T3, which goes by the
name adv3Lite, streamlines some of the difficulties that make TADS
intimidating. adv3Lite borrows a few useful ideas from Inform 7, in
fact. Nonetheless, the TADS programming language is as different from I7
as night and day. TADS 3 closely resembles traditional programming
languages such as C. (If you don’t know what that means, don’t worry
about it.)</p>

<p>Inform, TADS, and a couple of other authoring systems trace their
ancestry directly back to <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=fft6pu91j85y4acv">Crowther &amp; Woods’ Adventure</a>, a
text-based game that ran, initially, on mainframe computers in the
1970s. Today this type of interaction is called <em>parser-based,</em>
because the reader/player types commands (such as GO NORTH or GET LAMP)
that are processed by an internal routine called a parser. More
recently, a very different type of interactive fiction, sometimes called
<em>choice-based,</em> has become popular. In a choice-based fiction,
the reader/player is relieved of the burden of having to think what
command to type; instead, the story presents a few links that can be
clicked or tapped to move matters forward. Inform can be used to produce
clickable choice-based interactive fiction, but you won’t find much
about that concept in this book, because I frankly don’t find
choice-based fiction very interesting. To me, the fictional world of an
interactive story is much more engaging when the reader/player has to
figure out what to do, rather than being presented with a cut-and-dried
menu of choices.</p>

<p>The “natural language” programming interface of I7 makes I7 very
attractive to those who would like to write interactive stories but have
no background in computer programming. Also, at this writing the TADS 3
development environment, Workbench, is a Windows-only application. TADS
games can be played on the Mac or on a Linux computer, but the slick
development tools are Windows-specific. For classroom use, Inform 7 is a
better choice not only because the “natural language” aspects of the
system may be easier for the newcomer to understand, but because it
makes no difference whether a given student uses a Macintosh, Windows,
or Linux computer.</p>

<p>Inform games can be located on websites and played within a Web
browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer using systems
called Parchment and Quixe. (Internet Explorer seems to be a poor choice
for running Parchment and Quixe, in my limited testing. This is probably
because Parchment and Quixe are written in Javascript, and Microsoft
uses a non-standard implementation of Javascript in IE.) When you’ve
finished writing your game, these tools will make it easier than ever
for you to share it with players and fans. In fact, Inform allows you to
release your game in the form of a web page, so it will be ready to go &ndash;
assuming you have a website to which you can upload it.</p>

<p>If neither the no-compromise complexity of TADS 3 nor the friendly
but sometimes fuzzy approach of Inform 7 appeals to you, you can also
investigate Inform 6, which is a completely different and much more
traditional programming language, although it shares the “Inform” name,
or a simpler system such as ADRIFT or ALAN. ALAN is cross-platform (Mac,
Windows, Linux); ADRIFT is Windows-only. The full version of ADRIFT is
not free, but it’s very affordable.</p>

<p>A simpler option for writing interactive stories would be to use a
choice-based authoring system. Several are currently available,
including <a href="https://undum.com/">Undum</a>, <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a>,
and <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/">ChoiceScript</a>.
Choice-based stories are sometimes referred to as CYOA (choose your own
adventure), because their ancestry goes back to a flurry of CYOA
paperback books that was published in the 1970s. CYOA stories are not
puzzle-oriented, but some of the authoring systems are much easier to
use than Inform. (This is not true of Undum, by the way. Undum is quite
a lot harder to learn than Inform, but allows the author to do wonderful
effects.)</p>

<p>All of these systems, and others, are available for download on the
Web.</p>

<p>Like Inform itself, <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> is free. I hope
you find it useful. If there are areas where you feel it could be
expanded or improved, I hope you’ll fire off an email (good email
addresses are midiguru23@sbcglobal.net and editor@musicwords.net) and
let me know what you’d like to see. Updated versions may be released
from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>Thanks go first and foremost to Graham Nelson for the monumental task
of creating, developing, and maintaining Inform. Emily Short is tireless
in her assistance and support for Inform authors. David Kinder maintains
the Windows IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software for Inform
7, and Andrew Hunter the MacOS IDE. Andrew Plotkin’s Glulx system allows
large games and games with extra features to be written in Inform;
without Glulx, Inform would be a much less attractive proposition for
game designers.</p>

<p>Like Inform itself, <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> is a community
effort. Early drafts were read by Michael Callaghan, Eric Eve, Ron
Newcomb, Emily Short, Mike Tarbert, and Michael Neal Tenuis, all of whom
suggested valuable additions and clarifications. I also took advantage
of materials developed for other classes by Mark Engelberg and Jeff
Nyman. During the writing process, the experts on the intfiction.org
forum freely shared their knowledge with me; you’ll find their names
scattered throughout. I also cribbed a few questions posted at
intfiction.org by novice programmers, and made free use of questions and
concerns raised by the students in my own IF classes.</p>

<p><em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> was written using OpenOffice Writer,

<h2 id="chapter-1-getting-started">Chapter 1: Getting Started</h2>

<p>So … you’d like to try writing interactive fiction. It looks like
fun, but you’re not sure where to start. Or maybe you’ve already
started, and now you’re getting confused, or you’re not sure how to get
the results you want.</p>

<p>This book will help you make sense of it all. Every chapter (except
the last one, which is sort of a grab bag) is about one specific part of
the writing process.</p>

<p>You don’t need to read the book straight through from top to bottom.
Feel free to jump around, dipping into whatever chapter looks as if it
will have the information you need. If you want to write a story with
lots of characters, for instance, you may want to head straight to
Chapter 5. If you find that you’re having trouble writing things in a
way that Inform understands, you can consult the tips on phrasing and
punctuation in Chapter 9. Some of the discussion in that chapter is
pretty deep, though, so it may not be the best place to start learning.
(That’s why it’s Chapter 9, not Chapter 1.)</p>

<p>Even right here in Chapter 1, there are things you won’t need to
think about yet when you’re just starting out. If you hit something that
doesn’t make sense, feel free to skip it and come back to it later.</p>

<p>Unlike a technical document, which attempts to lay out the features
of a system in an orderly manner, explaining the most basic concepts
first in order to build on them later, the <em>Inform Handbook</em> is
organized in a way that attempts to get you started doing useful and
interesting things quickly. To be sure, the opening chapters cover the
basics and contain many cross-references to concepts that will be
explained later. Nonetheless, as early as Chapter 2 you’ll find things
like text substitutions and before, after, and instead rules used in the
example code with no real explanation of what they are or how they work.
When you encounter something in an example that is unfamiliar, you can
safely assume not only that it works, but that it will be explained in a
later chapter.</p>

<p>Whether you read this book or some other manual, or just dive in and
start trying things without bothering to read a manual at all, you’ll
soon learn that writing interactive fiction (“IF” for short) is more
than just creative writing. Creativity and storytelling are definitely
part of the process, but you’ll also be doing a type of <em>computer
programming</em>. “Programming” means you’re giving the computer
instructions about what to do. And computers are incredibly picky about
understanding your instructions! As you start writing IF, you’ll find
that a single misspelled word or a missing period at the end of a
sentence can stop the computer dead in its tracks. Later in this chapter
I’ll give you a short list of mistakes that I’ve seen students make.</p>

<p>This book is about how to use the popular Inform 7 programming
language (“I7” for short). There are several other languages in which
you can write interactive fiction, as mentioned in the Foreword. If
you’re using one of them, you’ll find a few general tips in this book
that you can use. In particular, the discussion of <a href="#chapter-6-puzzles">puzzles in Chapter 6</a>
is largely platform-independent. Nonetheless, the book is mostly about
how to use I7.</p>

<p>I feel Inform 7 is an especially good choice for those who are new to
writing IF and also new to computer programming. I7 is designed to make
it as easy as possible to get started. The computer code you’ll be
writing looks very much like plain English, because (barring a few
oddities) it <em>is</em> plain English. Having said that, it has to be
admitted that the I7 application (in which you’ll be writing your game)
has a number of facets, which can make it seem intimidatingly
complex.</p>

<p>Certain features that experienced may expect, such as single-step
debugging, are not possible with I7. Even so, I7 includes many “power
user” features for game design, so it won’t limit you if you want your
story to include complex things.</p>

<p>As a <em>caveat,</em> however, I should add that if you’re thinking
you’ll dip your toes in the ocean of computer programming by writing
some interactive fiction and then later consider moving on to a
general-purpose language like Javascript or C++, Inform 7 would be a
poor choice. Its syntax is quite unlike what you’ll find in most
programming languages, and the programming skills you learn by writing
stories in I7 will be difficult to translate into a form you can use in
any other programming language.</p>

<p>Inform 7 is the successor to Inform 6, which is also a popular
language for writing IF. The two are completely different, even though
they were created by the same person, Graham Nelson, and are both called
“Inform.” In this book, we’ll most often refer to “Inform” and not
bother to add the 7, but all of these references are to Inform 7, not to
Inform 6.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Inform 7 is still being developed. The
most recent version at this writing (spring 2015) is version 6L38. It
and its immediate predecessor, 6L02, are significantly different from
earlier versions. People have been using I7 successfully to write
interactive fiction for close to ten years, but like most other
programming languages, it isn’t officially finished, and may never be.
If certain of the details in this book don’t seem correct when you try
them out, it’s possible that you’re using an earlier or later version of
Inform, in which the features are different. The basic I7 language is
pretty well developed, and probably won’t change too drastically in the
future, but the recent refinements are significant.</p>

<p>In addition to possible changes in the language, the numbering of
pages and Examples in Inform’s built-in Documentation is quite likely to
change. Please note that all of the page and Example numbers given in
the <em>Handbook</em> refer to version 6L38.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="is-it-a-game-or-is-it-a-story">Is It a Game, or Is It a Story?</h4>

<p>In <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em>, we’ll refer to an Inform project
as either a “story” or a “game,” without making much of a distinction
between the two words. There are some real differences: Some interactive
fiction has a strong story and very little in the way of game-type fun.
Other interactive fiction is mainly a game, and the story is so weak it
might as well not exist at all.</p>

<p>It’s up to you to decide how to combine story elements with game
elements. For the purposes of this book, the game is a story and the
story is a game. In recent years the designers of Inform have been
leaning toward “story” as a term for what you’ll be producing, but I
still prefer to think of it as a game.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="downloading-installing">Downloading &amp; Installing</h3>

  <p>To get the most current version of Inform, go to the <a href="inform7.com/downloads/">Inform 7 Downloads page</a>,
    and select the appropriate version.</p>

<p>Install the program and launch it, as described in the next
section.</p>

<p>As you work with Inform, you’ll be creating projects. Each game that
you create is a separate project. It’s a good idea to start by creating
a folder called Inform Projects inside your Documents (Windows: My
Documents) folder. This may be done for you automatically when you
install Inform, or you may need to do it manually. Each time you create
a new project, save it to that folder.</p>

<h3 id="the-inform-7-program">The Inform 7 Program</h3>

<p>The first time you launch the Inform 7 program, a dialog box will ask
you whether you want to open an existing project or start a new one.
Since you don’t yet have a project to open, select “Start a new
project&hellip;”. This will open a box in which you can name your project and
tell Inform where you want to save it. (Use the Inform Projects folder
in your Documents folder. If this folder doesn’t yet exist, it’s a good
idea to create it.)</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/start_a_new_project.jpg"></div>

<p>When you close this box, the Inform program will open, and you’ll see
a main window with two pages &ndash; a left page and a right page. The left
page will be blank except for the name of your new game and the byline
(your name as the author). On the right page you’ll see the Table of
Contents for the Inform Documentation.</p>

<p>What you’re looking at is not Inform itself (though you can think of
it that way if you want to). What you’re looking at is a program that’s
sort of a container for the Inform game programming system. This type of
program is called an Integrated Development Environment, or “IDE” for
short. The Inform IDE has quite a lot of useful features. Before you
start writing your first story, take a quick look around the Inform IDE.
Its most important features are discussed in the next few sections of
this chapter; others are mentioned in <a href="#chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10, Advanced Topics</a>.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/ide_documentation_pane.jpg"></div>
  
<p>Normally, you’ll want to keep the text of the story you’re writing
(Inform calls this the “source text,” a term precisely equivalent to the
more familiar term “source code,” which is used in most other
programming languages) in the left-hand page. The right-hand page will
contain various things at various times &ndash; the Documentation, the game
itself, error messages, and so on. The IDE will sometimes open new
<em>panels</em> automatically within the right-hand page. But in fact
you can display whatever you’d like in either page. If you’re studying
two related pages in the Documentation, for instance, you could have one
open in the left page of the IDE, and the other open in the right page
at the same time. You can even run two instances of the Inform IDE at
the same time, by opening additional project files. This way, you can
keep the Documentation pages open at all times, or copy what you’ve
written from one project to another.</p>

<p>To choose what’s displayed in each page, click on an item in the row
of page headers. (This is displayed across the top of the pages in the
Windows IDE, and vertically along the right edge in the Macintosh IDE.)
Each header opens a different panel<em>.</em></p>

<p>Until you’ve written something in the Source panel and clicked the
Go! button, some of the other panels will be empty. This is normal.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/help.png"></div>

<p>Feel free to click on the
gray buttons beside the chapter headings in the Documentation. These
triangles open the lists of pages for each chapter. Read a few pages. If
you see things that you don’t understand (and you will!), please don’t
worry about it. Even in Chapter 1 of the Documentation, some of the
information is fairly advanced, and won’t be useful to you yet. Just
take a look and get acquainted with how the Documentation is set up. To
return to the Documentation’s Table of Contents, click the circle with
the arrow, or the Home button above it.</p>

<p>You can click the right-pointing arrow to go to the next page within
the Documentation, or the left arrow to go back one page. You’ll also
find a pair of left/right browser-style buttons near the upper left
corner of the pages, which will move you back and forth among the pages
you have looked at most recently.</p>

<p>In <em>The Inform 7 Handbook,</em> references to “the Documentation”
are generally about <em>Writing with Inform.</em> The table of contents
for <em>Writing with Inform</em> is in the left column of the
Documentation pane. In the right column is the table of contents of
<em>The Inform Recipe Book.</em> The <em>Recipe Book</em> is an entirely
separate manual. Both of them are well worth reading. They share the
same set of Examples. In fact, some of the pages in these manuals
provide only a quick overview of a topic, an overview that is fleshed
out with details in the accompanying Examples. Study the Examples
carefully, and try to figure out what each section in each Example does.
For tips on how to use the Examples, see <a
href="#using-the-built-in-documentation">How to Use the Built-In
Documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-page-headers">The Page Headers</h4>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/page_headers.jpg"></div>

<p>Across the top of each page, if
you’re using the Windows IDE, or vertically along the edge if you’re
using the Macintosh IDE, you’ll see a series of panel tabs, or headers:
Source, Results, Index, Skein, Transcript, Story, Documentation,
Extensions, and Settings. Below these main headers a variety of subheads
(such as Examples and General Index) may appear. Clicking on any of the
headers opens up a new panel. We’ll save a discussion of the finer
points of how to use the Skein, Transcript, and Index for <a href="#chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10, Advanced Topics</a>. In
this chapter we’ll just introduce the panels briefly.</p>

<p>The <strong>Source</strong> panel is where you’ll write your game. At
the top of the panel you’ll see two buttons: Source and Contents. When
you start designing your first game, the Contents panel won’t be useful;
in fact, it will be empty except for a brief explanatory message about
what it’s designed to do. In large or even medium-sized Inform projects,
though, you’ll want to add heads and subheads to your source text (see
<a href="#headings">headings</a>).
“Source” is computer jargon for what you’re writing &ndash; everything that
you’re writing, in fact, both the text that will be displayed in your
game when it’s played, and the instructions you give Inform that control
how the game works.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/story_headings.png"></div>

<p>Once
you’ve added some headings, the Contents sub-panel within the Source
panel will give you a quick way to navigate around in the source. You
can quickly jump from one section to another section that’s hundreds of
lines away, without having to use the scroll bar beside the panel and
hunt for the section you’re seeking. At right is what a portion of the
Contents of my game “A Flustered Duck” looked like back in 2009.
Clicking on any line of the tree will take you to that section of the
source code. To see more or less detail in the Contents, you can use the
menu (Mac) or slider (Windows) at the bottom of the Contents panel.</p>

<p>Inform is different from most computer programming languages in that
the source for your entire project will be contained in one document
(that is, in one file). Using the Contents panel, however, you can
navigate through this document in much the same way that you would by
jumping from one source code file to another if you were using a
different programming language. (Technically, it’s possible to
distribute your source code across a number of separate files and
include these as extensions in your main story file; but this is not a
recommended procedure.)</p>

<p>The Source panel provides an important and useful feature called
<strong>syntax coloring</strong>. You don’t need to do anything to set
this up: It happens automatically. As you start working with Inform,
you’ll find that different types of text within the source will be
displayed in different colors. For instance, text in double-quotes will
always be blue. Syntax coloring is used in most forms of computer
programming. It’s just a friendly feature to make it easier for you to
read what you’re writing; the colors have no effect on the game
itself.</p>

<p>The <strong>Results</strong> panel (which used to be called Errors)
will open up automatically in the right-hand page when you click the Go!
button (see below) if Inform can’t figure out what you wrote. Except
when dealing with problems, you can ignore the Results panel.</p>

<p>The <strong>Index</strong> is extremely useful. Until you’ve compiled
your first game, however (see “The Go! Button,” below), the Index will
be blank. (Depending on the version of the IDE that you’re using, it may
not open at all until you’ve successfully compiled a game.) In the
process of turning your source text into a game, Inform creates and
organizes lists of practically everything in the game. By consulting the
pages of the Index, you can learn a lot about Inform, and also spot
problems in your game, or just get an energy boost from seeing that your
game is getting bigger as the automatically generated map grows.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/project_index.jpg"></div>

<p>The Index panel is divided into seven pages: Actions, Contents,
Kinds, Phrasebook, Rules, Scenes, and World. We’ll have more to say
about these in <a href="#chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10, Advanced Topics</a>. The Home button takes you to the overview
display seen here. Clicking on any of the colored boxes will take you to
a particular part of the Index of your game.</p>

<p>The <strong>Skein</strong> is used mainly for testing your game while
you write it. The Skein will become a useful tool as your game gets more
complex, but when you’re just starting out, you can safely ignore it.
Briefly, the Skein keeps a record of all of your play sessions as you
test your work-in-progress. One of the ways to test your work after
making some changes is to open up the Skein, right-click (Mac:
control-click) on one of the lozenge-shaped <em>nodes,</em> and choose
“Play to Here” from the pop-up menu. This will repeat the commands you
typed on that particular run-through. For more on the Skein, see <a href="#the-skein">The Skein</a> and
consult <a href="../WI_1.html"><em>Writing with Inform</em> Chapter 1</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Transcript</strong> panel is also a tool for advanced
programming situations. To be honest, in writing my first large Inform 7
game, I never used the Transcript, so I’m not sure how it might have
made the writing process easier. It gives you a way to “bless” the
output of a play-through of your game. If you later make changes in the
game that change the output, the Transcript will highlight the changes
in the output so that you can decide if you like them, or if you’ve made
a mistake. If you’re playing through a long game quickly, this should
save you the trouble of having to read every word in the output on every
run-through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Story</strong> panel is where your game will appear,
allowing you to try it out as you’re developing it. You can’t run other
games in the Story panel (unless you download the source code), only the
game that you’re writing. The appearance of your game in the Story panel
will be similar to, but possibly not identical to, the way it will look
in an interpreter. Other people will play your game in an interpreter
(see “Downloading &amp; Playing Games,” later in this chapter), which is
a separate program, or by running an online interpreter in a Web
browser. As long as your game is written in English, the text of your
game should be identical no matter what interpreter it’s played in. (Not
all interpreters support the Unicode letters needed by other languages.)
Even with games whose output is in English, the visual appearance and
the type font may not be the same from one interpreter to another. For
this reason, near the end of the process of creating an Inform story
you’ll want to test your work in one or more other interpreters. Some
interpreters may not have been updated for full compatibility with the
latest version of Inform.</p>

<p>As a general rule, relying on the visual appearance of your game to
give players important information is not a great idea. Not only will
the appearance vary from one interpreter to another, but interactive
fiction is popular among blind computer users, because they can easily
play games of this type using screen reader software. In general,
anything that your players will need to know to play the game should be
presented as ordinary text. It’s possible to use Inform to create hybrid
games that make considerable use of graphics, clickable links, and other
resources, but the methods for doing this are beyond the scope of this
<em>Handbook.</em> For more information, see <a href="../WI_23.html"><strong>Chapter 23</strong>
of <em>Writing with Inform</em>, “Figures, Sounds and Files.”</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Documentation</strong> panel provides access to two large
tutorial/reference works: <em>Writing with Inform</em> and <em>The</em>
<em>Inform Recipe Book</em>. Both of these are hugely valuable
resources, and you’ll want to get to know them. Also in the
Documentation panel is a list of <a href="../examples/">more than 400 Examples</a> showing how to
use Inform. See <a
href="#using-the-built-in-documentation">Using the Built-in Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Extensions</strong> panel is where you’ll find the
extensions that you’ve installed. Inform authors rely extensively on
extensions, which are written by third parties. Extensions typically add
new features to the Inform programming language. In this book we’ll be
making use of a number of extensions. The details on how to add
extensions to your Inform application can be found near the end of this
chapter. See <a href="#extensions-for-inform">Extensions for Inform</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> panel is not often needed. Its main
purpose is to let you choose the type of output file you’ll use for your
finished game. Older versions of Inform 7 defaulted to the .z5 format
used in Infocom games, and gave you the larger .z8 format and the new
Glulx format as options. Today, Glulx is the default. If your game
contains images or sounds, you’ll need to switch to Glulx no matter how
large or small the game may be, and also check the “Create a Blorb
archive for release” box before clicking the Release button in the main
toolbar. The .z8 format may be preferable for games intended to be
played online in a web browser, but games that have more than a few
rooms and objects are likely to exceed the memory capacity of .z8.</p>

<p>Inform’s ability to handle images and sounds is cool, but fairly
limited. If you want to write a game that relies heavily on graphics
rather than text, you may want to consider using some other development
system, not Inform.</p>

<p>Also in the Settings panel is a checkbox to make random numbers
repeatable while you’re testing your game. If your game relies on
“rolling the dice,” for example to decide the outcome of a combat, to
move some of the characters from room to room, or just to choose among a
few random alternatives when printing out atmospheric bits of text,
using this checkbox will let you test the game more easily.</p>

<h4 id="the-go-button">The Go! Button</h4>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/go.png"></div>

<p>In my kitchen I have a
wonderful invention called a Zojirushi bread machine. It bakes home-made
bread. All I have to do is measure the raw ingredients, pour them into
the pan, close the lid, and press the Start button. Little paddles
inside the machine knead the dough. Then the machine waits an hour for
the dough to rise before it heats up and starts baking. Three hours
after I put in the ingredients, I have a steaming hot loaf of fresh
bread.</p>

<p>Inform’s Go! button is a lot like the Start button on my bread
machine. The text you write in the Source panel is the raw ingredients &ndash;
the flour, water, sugar, yeast, and so on. When you click the Go!
button, Inform churns and kneads what you’ve written and turns it into a
game that can be played. This function is explained in <a href="../WI_1.html#section4">WI 1.4: The Go! button</a>.</p>

<p>This process looks very simple &ndash; you just click a button. But Inform
does a huge amount of work to translate your source text into a game.
This work is done by a software “machine” called a
<strong>compiler</strong>.<span id="Ref_compiler" class="anchor"></span>
There’s no need for you to be concerned about how the compiler works its
magic. But since we’ll be referring to it here and there in this book,
you need to know that it exists, and what it does. The compiler turns
your source text into a playable game.</p>

<p>If I put too much water into my bread machine, the machine won’t
know. It will just produce a “loaf” that’s a soggy mess. If I forget to
add the yeast, the machine will go ahead and do its thing, and I’ll end
up with a hard, teeth-breaking lump. The bread machine doesn’t look at
what I put in the pan &ndash; it just runs through its own process, step by
step, automatically.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/error.png"></div>

<p>A compiler is a lot smarter than a bread machine. In order to do its
work, the Inform compiler has to scrutinize every single line that
you’ve written and figure out what to do with it. If it understands what
you’ve written, a few seconds after you click Go!, your game will pop up
in the right-hand page, ready to play. More than half the time, though,
the compiler will encounter problems. It will hit a word, sentence, or
paragraph that it can’t make sense of. Instead of your game appearing in
the right-hand page, you’ll see a page like the one shown at right, in
which Inform will report on the problems it ran into.</p>

<p>This is nothing to worry about &ndash; it’s normal. What you need to do is
find the problems, fix them, and click Go! again. Depending on the exact
problem(s), you may have to go through this cycle five or six times
before your work-in-progress will compile successfully.</p>

<p>Next to each problem report in the right-hand pane, you may see a
little orange arrow. When you click on this, the Source page will jump
directly to the problem paragraph, which will be highlighted. If the
problem is in an extension, a separate edit window will open containing
the extension code. The orange arrow doesn’t always appear, however; in
the report shown here, the problem is identified correctly (the word
“comma” was misspelled as “coma” by the author), but no orange arrow is
provided. The current release of the Macintosh IDE, in particular, seems
not too fond of providing orange arrows. Nonetheless, the report will
tell you what you need to fix; the IDE’s search function will enable you
to find the incorrect line. You may also see a blue question-mark
button. Clicking on this will take you to a page in <em>Writing with
Inform</em> that may (or may not) help you understand the nature of the
problem.</p>

<p>Each problem message will give you some information about the type of
problem the compiler ran into. Sometimes these explanations will make
instant sense. Other times, they’re more confusing than helpful. For
instance, if you write a text for output (in quotation marks) but forget
to put the command “say” (not in quotation marks) before it, you’ll see
an error message along these lines: “Problem. You wrote '"Some text."' :
but this is a phrase which I don't recognise, possibly because it is one
you meant to define but never got round to, or because the wording is
wrong (see the Phrasebook section of the Index to check). Alternatively,
it may be that the text immediately previous to this was a definition
whose ending, normally a full stop, is missing?” As you can see, this
message directs you to the line where the problem is, but misdiagnoses
the problem. In general, Inform’s error messages have gotten
progressively better, but they’re not likely ever to be perfect, simply
because authors are so creative about inventing new errors.</p>

<p>After a while you’ll start to get a feel for the types of errors you
usually make, and the problem messages you’ll see as a result. For more
details, see <a href="#all-about-bugs">All About Bugs</a>, later in this chapter. But if all goes
well, your game will appear in the right-hand page, in the Story panel,
ready for you to try it out.</p>

<p>One thing you may want to know about the Go! button is that when you
click it, the first thing that Inform does is save your Source to a file
on disk. This new file will overwrite anything that was in the file
before. So if you’re trying out various kinds of changes in your game,
you may want to create alternate versions of the game &ndash; one to
experiment with and one as a safe backup copy. To make a separate copy
of the game that you can experiment with, use the Save As&hellip; command in
the File menu.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="common-coding-problems">Six Common Problems</h4>

<p>As I watch beginners start to learn Inform, I see certain kinds of
problems showing up over and over. Here, in no particular order, are
some things to watch out for in your code:</p>

<p><strong>Forgetting to say “say”.</strong> You want the game to produce a certain text
output in a certain situation, so you just write it, surrounding it with
quotation marks as usual. In a couple of cases, such as descriptions of
rooms, this is okay. But if you’re writing a rule in which you want
Inform to say something, you have to say “say” before you start the
quoted text.</p>

<p><strong>Missing period at the end of a sentence.</strong> Always end sentences with
periods. There are some special rules about placing periods in relation
to quotation marks, but if the sentence doesn’t have a period at all,
Inform may get confused. If the sentence is in the middle of a paragraph
of code (as opposed to a quoted block of output text), Inform is almost
certain to get confused.</p>

<p><strong>Misspelled word.</strong> An easy problem to run into, and sometimes hard to
spot. You’ll be typing the word “description” a lot, and at a high
screen resolution you may not notice at first that you’ve spelled it
“descripton” or “descrpition”.</p>

<p><strong>Colon instead of semicolon or vice-versa.</strong> These two
marks look almost alike on the screen, but they’re completely different.
A semicolon is like a stop sign on the street; it tells Inform, “Okay,
stop here for just a second, and then go on, because we’re not done
yet.” A colon is like an arrow pointing forward &ndash; it tells Inform, “Do
this next.”</p>

<p><strong>Wrong indents.</strong> See <a href="#indenting">indenting</a>
for a full explanation of how
Inform handles indentation.</p>

<p><strong>Jumbled thinking.</strong> To write IF, you need to work in a
patient, logical, step-by-step manner. Trying to design a complicated
action sequence before you’ve learned the basics is guaranteed to
frustrate you &ndash; and if you post plaintive questions on the forum asking
for help, you may not understand or know how to apply the answers that
more knowledgeable authors give you.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="the-release-button">The Release Button</h4>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/release.png"></div>

<p>When your game is finished &ndash;
or maybe not quite finished, but far enough along that it’s ready to
share with other people so they can test it, find problems, and offer
suggestions &ndash; you can click the Release button. This will produce a game
file in the .z8 or Glulx format, depending on what you’ve specified in
the Settings panel. You can give this file to other people, or attach it
to an email and send it to them. They’ll be able to load it into an
interpreter and play your game.</p>

<p>Some of the features that you can use while testing your game in the
IDE (see <a href="#using-the-debugging-commands">Using the Debugging Commands</a>, later in this chapter) will not
be available in the release version. However, the extremely handy
Release For Testing command in the Release menu gives you a way to
create a game file for your testers that <em>does</em> include the
debugging commands.</p>

<p>When you use the Release button, you’ll see (in the right-side panel)
a list of suggestions for things you may want to consider adding to a
released game. These options are not found in the Release menu in the
IDE. Instead, you invoke them by adding statements to your source. For
  instance, you might want to write:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Release along with cover art, a solution, and a website.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Release along with cover art, a solution, and a website.</div>
</div>

<p>The release options are explained in <a href="../WI_25.html">WI Chapter 25: Releasing</a>.</p>

<h4 id="other-features">Other Features</h4>

<p>The Stop button is found only in the Windows IDE. It’s not used
often, but you won’t be able to make certain kinds of edits in the Skein
while the game is running. (That would be like trying to change to a new
pair of ice-skates while skating around the rink.) The Stop button will
end the current play session, making these Skein edits possible.</p>

<p>The Macintosh version of the Inform IDE includes, in the Window menu,
a Customize Toolbar command. In the current version, however, this
doesn’t work. In theory, you can drag a Watch or Breakpoints button into
the toolbar, for instance &ndash; but Inform has, at present, neither of these
types of functionality. (Watching expressions and setting breakpoints
are techniques used by programmers in debugging computer software.)
Perhaps in a future release of Inform, you’ll be able to add useful
tools to the toolbar.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="source-code-or-text">Source: Code or Text?</h4>

<p>Computer programmers call what they write <em>source code.</em> The
term “code” goes back to the early days of computer programming, and
probably reflects the fact that most computer programming languages look
as abstract and hard to understand as messages encrypted in a secret
code. The creators of Inform prefer to refer to what you write as
<em>source text,</em> because they feel “text” is a friendlier term to
use to describe what you’ll be writing. However, most of the time,
<em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> will refer to what you’re writing as
“source code” or just “code,” because the word “text” in Inform also
refers to the sentences you write between double-quotes, which are
intended as output during your game. Ambiguity has its uses in
literature, and also in real life, but in general it’s not desirable in
computer programming situations. I prefer to use the word “text”
specifically to refer to the output that your readers/players will
encounter. Nonetheless, when discussing the source code that you write,
we’ll sometimes use the word “text.”</p>
</div>

<h3 id="using-the-built-in-documentation">Using the Built-In Documentation</h3>

<p>Many people use Inform’s built-in Documentation as a combined
tutorial and reference guide. When starting out, you’ll probably want to
use it more as a tutorial. To do this, read Chapters 2 through 7 and try
out the Examples. The examples can easily be copied into a test game so
you can try them out and experiment with them.</p>

<p>First, start a new project or open up a project that you don’t mind
trashing. I keep a game called Test Game on my hard drive for this
purpose. (Actually, I have dozens of them.) You pretty much have to
start with a blank Source when trying the Examples, because pasting the
Example code into an existing game will most likely make a mess of a
game that you’re already working on.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/port_royal_3.jpg"></div>

<p>After navigating to the Documentation page that you’re interested in
and possibly scrolling down to the bottom, open up an Example by
clicking on the blue lozenge-shaped button with the number. If the
Source page in your Test Game is still empty, you can click on the
square blue button by the first line of the code in the Example. This
button will copy the entire Example over to the Source page. If you’re
already working on a game and don’t have an empty Source page, click on
the arrow button instead. This will open an entirely new Inform IDE
window with the Example code loaded. Now all you need to do is click
Go!, and the Example will turn into a short but playable game. After
playing the game to see what it does, try changing some of the source
code and play it again. This is a great way to learn how Inform works.
(Due to ongoing changes in the Inform language, however, it’s possible
that a few of the older Examples won’t work correctly. If you encounter
this type of problem, post a message asking for help on the <a href="http://www.intfiction.org/forum/">IntFiction forum</a>.)</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/port_royal_1.png"></div>

<p>All of the Examples are used in both <em>Writing with Inform</em> and
the <em>Recipe Book.</em> If you’ve opened the Example from within
<em>Writing with Inform,</em> the yellow RB button on the right side of
the Example’s header takes you to the page in the <em>Recipe Book</em>
where it’s used. From Examples in the <em>Recipe Book,</em> the gray WI
button will take you back to the Example in <em>Writing with
Inform.</em></p>

<p>Once you’ve read through large parts of the Documentation (perhaps
several times), it will get easier to find the information you need. The
Documentation now has an index, which you can reach by clicking the
General Index tab at the upper right corner. In case that doesn’t get
you where you need to go, the IDE includes a Search field. You can type
whatever you’d like in this field, and Inform will go through all of the
Documentation looking for matches. You may find anything from no matches
to dozens of them. The more specific you can be about what you’re
looking for, the better the Search engine will work. Phrases like “end
the story” and “omit contents in listing” will work better than
something like “scenery”, which produces way too many matches. In the
Windows IDE, the search results will be highlighted in the text, making
the word or phrase easy to find. The Macintosh IDE does not yet have
this neat feature.</p>

<p>Once you’ve successfully compiled your story for the first time, the
Index panel will contain numerous links (the blue question-mark buttons
and gray magnifying-glass buttons) to the Documentation. Before too long
you should take some time to explore the Index. While it’s almost
bewilderingly thorough, has links to lots of good information.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-in-a-game">What Happens in a Game</h3>

<p>If you’ve played a few parser-based interactive fiction games, you
won’t need to be told how IF works. But for the benefit of those who may
just be getting started, we’ll cover the basics here. Parser-based IF is
a bit different from hypertext stories in which you move through the
story by clicking or tapping links; we’ll have little more to say in the
<em>Handbook</em> about this type of user interface, though in fact some
extensions to Inform (notably <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/9.3/Aaron%20Reed/Keyword%20Interface.i7x">Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed</a>) have been
created that add the ability to insert clickable links in your
story.</p>

<p>In a game, you play the part of a character in a story. The story may
have a simple concept, or it may be quite complex, involving many
characters, locations, and events. In a simple story, you (the
character) might be wandering around in a cave, collecting treasures. In
a complex story, you’ll most likely meet other characters, and you may
need to outwit them or make friends with them. The story may have
several different endings, some of them happy and others not so happy.
One of your tasks as a player/reader will be to figure out which actions
lead to a happy ending. But until you start taking actions, you won’t
know which choices lead to which endings.</p>

<h4 id="entering-commands">Entering Commands</h4>

<p>To play the game, you type <em>commands</em> (instructions to the
computer) when you see the command prompt. The <span
id="Ref_command_prompt" class="anchor"></span>command prompt generally
looks like this:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span></div>
</div>
<p>The words you type at the prompt are called the command line, and
this method of interacting with the computer is called a <em>command
line interface</em> (CLI). The command line interface was common in
computers in the 1970s, when interactive fiction was first invented, but
today most computer users may not even know that their computer’s
operating system has this type of interface. It’s well hidden.</p>

<p>Unlike a video game, where you need quick reflexes to deal with
animated characters who are moving around, in a text game nothing
happens until you type a command and hit the computer’s Enter key. When
you press Enter, the game reads your latest command and prints out a
response. (There are rare exceptions to this &ndash; text games that have some
real-time features, which cause time to advance in the story whether or
not you enter a command.)</p>

<p>What kinds of commands can you enter? The commands tend to have a
common form, which we’ll discuss here, but each game may have a few
unexpected commands of its own. Part of the challenge of interactive
fiction (indeed, most of the challenge) is figuring out which commands
to enter, and when. A command that works beautifully in one scene may
not produce useful results in another. It’s up to the player to discover
how exactly to use the commands in any given game.</p>

<p>Some of the responses that the game gives when you enter commands may
be error messages: Maybe you misspelled a word, for instance, so the
game doesn’t know what you meant. In this case, try typing OOPS followed
by the correct spelling. The result might look like this:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Dungeon</p>

<p>A dank and dismal dungeon. You can go north.</p>

<p>You can see a tool chest (closed) here.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>open chet</div>

<p>You can't see any such thing.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>oops chest</div>

<p>It's awkward, but you manage to open the tool chest while wearing the
handcuffs.</p>
</div>
<p>Assuming your command makes sense, the response will show you what’s
happening in the story. The command you entered may cause a change in
the world of the story, or it may just give you more details about
what’s going on.</p>

<p>If you’re playing a game, you don’t often need to pause to think
about exactly how the game is able to read your commands and respond to
them. But while writing a game, you’ll need to know more than a few
details. The software gadget that reads and interprets what the player
types is called a <span id="Ref_parser"
class="anchor"></span><strong>parser</strong><em>.</em> Every text game
that uses a command line interface has a parser (although the parser
used in games that are written using the ADRIFT programming system is so
crude as almost not to be worthy of the name). The parser that’s built
into Inform 7 is very sophisticated. It’s able to understand quite a
variety of inputs from the player. You can also change what it does, if
you need to. Many of the techniques for doing that are explained in this
<em>Handbook.</em> For instance, you can add to the types of commands
that the parser understands. You can also change the error messages that
it prints out when it doesn’t understand what the player typed or can’t
do the operation that the player has requested.</p>

<p>No parser is able to understand the kinds of complex sentences that
you and I speak and write every day. The parser is designed to process
simple commands, such as OPEN THE DOOR and PICK UP THE BALL. Most
commands are of the form &lt;VERB&gt; &lt;NOUN&gt; &lt;MAYBE A
PREPOSITION&gt; &lt;MAYBE ANOTHER NOUN&gt;.</p>

<p>Some verbs (such as WAIT, SLEEP, and JUMP) are followed by no nouns
at all. Some verbs need one noun &ndash; for instance, OPEN THE DOOR and PICK
UP THE BALL. A few verbs take two nouns, which are (usually) separated
by a preposition. Examples would include PUT THE BOX ON THE TABLE and
HIT THE OGRE WITH THE STICK.</p>

<p>When you’re entering commands during a game, the word THE can always
be left out, and most experienced players never use it. They would just
type HIT OGRE WITH STICK. That works perfectly. (Or at least, it works
perfectly if the player character is holding a stick, if there’s an ogre
in the room, and if the author has taken the trouble to tell Inform what
should happen in response to that command.) Think of the command line
syntax in interactive fiction as a form of Caveman English. TAKE BALL.
OPEN DOOR. It’s easy, once you get used to it.</p>

<p>If an object has a name that includes an adjective or two, you’ll
probably be able to use just an adjective to refer to it. If the object
is called “the tarnished gold crown” in the game, typing PICK UP GOLD
should work (at least, it will work if the author has done a decent job
writing the game).</p>
<p>Once in a while, the parser will ask the player for more information.
For instance, if you’re in a room with a gold crown, a gold ring, and a
gold orb, when you type PICK UP GOLD the parser will respond, “Which do
you mean, the gold crown, the gold ring, or the gold orb?” At this
point, the parser will try to interpret your next input as an answer to
the question. If you just type ORB, the parser will understand that you
meant PICK UP GOLD ORB, and the game will proceed to do that action.</p>

<p>If you’re in a room with another character, you can try giving them a
command, like this: BOB, PICK UP THE STICK. Bob may or may not do what
you want &ndash; at the moment, we’re just looking how commands are entered.
Here, you type the name of the character, then a comma, then the
command. (To learn how to write a game so that characters will respond
to the player’s commands, see <a
href="#giving-orders-to-characters">Giving Orders to Characters</a>.)</p>

<p>Most interactive stories take place in what’s called a <em>model
world</em>. This is a place that was created by the author of the story.
It exists only within the computer &ndash; and in fact, only within the game’s
interpreter software. It might be an ancient castle, the interior of a
space station, or a busy modern city. The model world always consists of
one or more <em>rooms.</em> The rooms are the locations where the story
takes place. A “room” might be a large open field, or it might be the
interior of a small, stuffy cardboard box. The word “room” is used in IF
authoring to refer to each of the locations in the game, whether or not
the location is literally a room.</p>

<p>If you want to see what’s in the room with you, you can use the
command LOOK (this can be abbreviated L). When you LOOK, you’ll read a
description of the room and its contents. In general, you can only see
what’s in the room with you; you can’t see into any other rooms. Some
games have windows you can look through, but basically windows have to
be “faked” using some clever programming tricks.</p>

<p>If there’s more than one room in the game, you’ll be able to move
from room to room. This is usually done by typing commands based on
compass directions &ndash; for instance, GO NORTH. This type of command is so
common that it can be abbreviated. You can type N to go north, NE to go
northeast, E to go east, SE to go southeast, and so on. Depending on the
type of world where the story takes place, the directions you can travel
may also include up (U), down (D), in, and out.</p>

<p>The use of compass directions in IF is artificial but convenient.
From time to time authors try to come up with alternatives, but none of
these has caught on. In “Blue Lacuna” (a large, complex game written in
Inform), Aaron Reed used a neat system in which certain words that are
highlighted in the text can be used as movement commands. For example,
if the word “beach” appears highlighted, typing BEACH will take you to
the beach. This system is available as an extension for Inform called
Keyword Interface. (For more on how to use extensions, see <a
href="#extensions-for-inform">Extensions for Inform</a>.)</p>

<p>As you travel through the model world, you’ll encounter various kinds
of objects. Some of them will be portable: You’ll be able to pick them
up, carry them around, and drop them in other locations. Other objects
will be scenery, and can’t be moved.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to do, when you enter a room, is EXAMINE
all of the objects that are mentioned in the room description. Most
modern games understand X as an abbreviation for EXAMINE, though a few
old-school games don’t. Read the room description carefully and then X
anything that’s mentioned. You may discover important details by doing
this.</p>

<p>If an object is portable, you’ll be able to pick it up. Let’s say the
object is a bowling ball. The commands PICK UP BALL, TAKE BALL, and GET
BALL all mean the same thing. (Inform authors call this the
<em>taking</em> action.) To read a list of the items you’re carrying,
use the INVENTORY command. This can be abbreviated INV, or simply I.</p>

<p>The game may limit, realistically, the number of objects you can
carry at any given time &ndash; after all, the player character probably has
only two hands! But players tend to find this limitation annoying. A
compromise solution adopted by many authors is to give the player a
sack, or something similar, whose capacity is basically unlimited. (See
learn how to make a <a href="#Ref_holdall">carry-all object for the player.)</a></p>

<p>Whether or not a game contains a carry-all, from time to time you’ll
probably find other containers. A container may be permanently open,
like a basket, or it may be something that you can OPEN and CLOSE, like
a suitcase. If a container is open, you can try putting things into it
using a command like PUT BOWLING BALL IN THIMBLE. Some of the things
that can be opened and closed can also be locked and unlocked.</p>

<p>Note that Inform’s standard locking and unlocking actions require
that the author create a key that fits the lock. By default, the action
UNLOCK DOOR is not defined in Inform, though you can create this type of
action yourself, for your own game. Inform’s unlocking action always
takes the form UNLOCK DOOR WITH RUSTY KEY. And of course the player must
be holding the correct key for that action to work.</p>

<p>Most games include puzzles. (For more on puzzles, see Chapter 6.)
Some puzzles are easy, and some are fiendishly difficult. These days,
many games have built-in hints that will help you if you don’t know how
to solve a puzzle, but in other games, it’s strictly up to your
ingenuity to figure out what to do. See <a href="#adding-hints">Adding Hints</a>.</p>

<p>Some games are friendly: You may get stuck for a while before you
figure out what you need to do next, but the worst thing that can happen
to the character whose role you’re playing is wandering around and not
knowing what to do next. Other games are cruel. In a cruel game, if you
do the wrong thing, your character can get killed, perhaps in a very
nasty way. Fortunately, the UNDO command will usually get you out of
trouble.</p>

<p>Not always, though. Some games are so cruel that they won’t let you
UNDO if your character has died. Because of that, it’s a good idea to
SAVE your game every so often, especially before trying anything that
might be dangerous. If you get killed or lose the game in some other
way, you’ll be able to RESTORE. The RESTORE command opens a dialog box
where you can choose a saved file to reopen. By choosing the most recent
saved file, you can revert to a point before you got in trouble.
(Wouldn’t it be nice if real life was like that?)</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4 id="its-all-about-you">It’s All About You!</h4>

<p>In most interactive fiction, you (the player) play the part of a
character called “you.” When the game prints out a message, such as “You
can’t see any such thing,” it’s talking about the character called
“you.” The pronoun “you” is grammatically in the second person, so we
say these games are written in <em>second person</em>. A few games are
written in which the character is “I” (first person) or “he” or “she”
(third person).</p>

<p>In most games, the action is described as taking place right now. For
instance, “You walk up the stairs.” Grammatically, this is called
<em>present tense.</em> A few games are written in past tense (“You
walked up the stairs.”) Second-person, present-tense storytelling is not
used much in novels or short stories, but it’s very normal in
interactive fiction. It’s possible to write a story in any combination
of person and tense, and the current version of Inform supports this
very nicely. You might want to give a period flavor to a story set in
the 18th century, for instance, by choosing past tense and third person:
“He walked up the stairs.” See <a
href="#story-tense-and-viewpoint">Story Tense and Viewpoint</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="downloading-playing-games">Downloading &amp; Playing Games</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to learn about game design is to download and
play a few games. A good place to start looking for games is the
<a href="https://ifdb.org/">Interactive Fiction Database</a>). On this
site you can read reviews of games, search for games by a particular
author, and click links to download the games themselves. Some games on
this site can be played online, in your browser, without
downloading.</p>

<p>Another resource for finding games is the archives of an online
magazine called <a href="http://www.spagmag.org/archives/">SPAG (the Society for the Promotion of Adventure Games</a>. Some games are
available from authors’ websites, but far more are to be found in the
<a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>. You
can find many <a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/games/glulx/">Inform games in the games/glulx directory of the
Archive</a> and the <a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/games/source/inform/">source code for many Inform games in games/source/inform at the Archive</a>.</p>

<p>To play text games, you’ll generally need both the game file itself
and a separate piece of software called an
<strong id="Ref_interpreter">interpreter</strong>. After downloading and installing an interpreter,
you’ll load the game into the interpreter to play it. A few games
written in TADS and some other development systems are available as
free-standing programs for Windows. <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/quixe/">Quixe</a> is a browser-based game player for large Inform games in the Glulx format.
Inform games in Glulx or the Z-machine's .z5 and .z8
formats can be played in a Web browser using <a href="https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment">Parchment</a>.</p>

<p>Currently the best interpreter is called <a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a>. It’s available for
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux (as an AppImage). You can <a href="https://github.com/garglk/garglk/releases">download the latest Gargoyle release</a> Gargoyle can play all Z-code (Inform) and Glulx games, as
well as TADS games and Hugo games.</p>

<div class="addendum">Gargoyle is still popular. Most Mac users like Spatterlight; Lectrote is another popular cohice.</div>


<h4 id="whats-this-.z8-stuff-all-about-anyway">What’s This .z8 Stuff All About, Anyway?</h4>

<p>In the beginning, there was Zork. Well, no, that wasn’t quite the
beginning. In the beginning was Adventure. Adventure was the very first
text-based computer game. It was freely copied and shared by computer
users in the 1970s, and was never a commercial product. But around 1980,
some clever people saw that they could make money on text-based games.
They started a company called Infocom. The first game that came from
Infocom was called Zork.</p>

<p>Zork was enormously successful, and led to a series of sequels, which
were also successful. But then, in the mid-1980s, computers became fast
enough to display graphics. Games that used graphics were much sexier
than text games. As a type of commercial product, text games pretty much
died. (Not entirely. Here and there you might find a text game for sale
&ndash; for example, at this writing Andrew Plotkin’s “Hadean Lands” is
available for iOS through the App Store. Text games are no longer a big
business, though.)</p>

<p>By the late 1980s, the text game boom had passed, but there were
still hundreds of thousands of computer users who owned Zork or one of
Infocom’s other games. These games were available for many different
computer operating systems (and at the time, there were a lot more
computer operating systems than there are today). The actual game data
was the same no matter what type of computer you owned, but Infocom
created a <em>virtual machine</em> for each operating system. A virtual
machine &hellip; well, let’s not worry about the technical details. A virtual
machine is a piece of software that pretends to be a piece of hardware.
The point is, if you had a virtual machine from Infocom for your
computer, you could play any of Infocom’s games. All you needed was the
data file for a particular game. You loaded the data file into the
virtual machine, and the game would appear on your screen.</p>

<p>The virtual machine developed by Infocom is what came to be called
the Z-machine. (Named after Zork, you see.) Even after Infocom closed
its doors, the Z-machine was still widely available, because a lot of
people had copies, and in those days copy-protected software was still a
few years in the future.</p>

<p>So when Graham Nelson started working on the first version of Inform
in the early 1990s, he made a very smart decision: He wouldn’t try to
write his own game delivery system from scratch. Instead, he’d create an
IF programming language that would produce game files that could be
loaded into the Z-machine. Inform was written in such a way that its
compiler would create Z-machine-compatible game files. These could then
be played by anyone who had a Z-machine on a disk. This was one of
several factors that insured the success of Inform.</p>

<p>Computers in those days had very little memory compared to computers
today, so the Z-machine had to be small and efficient. It could load and
run several different file types, but the most common had names that
ended with .z5 and .z8. A .z5 file could be as large as 256Kb (yes,
that’s kilobytes, not megabytes), while the larger .z8 format could be
used for games that needed to be as large as 512Kb.</p>

<p>Today, the Infocom-era Z-machine is ancient history. If you still
have an Atari or Kaypro computer in working condition, and a Z-machine
interpreter for that computer, you could play a game written today in
Inform, as long as the game was compiled as a .z5 or .z8 file. But who
owns a Kaypro anymore? Today, several newer IF interpreters have been
written that are compatible with the original Z-machine game file
format. These have names like Frotz and Nitfol (both of which were magic
words in one of the Zork sequels).</p>

<p>In order to allow Inform authors to write larger games, Andrew
Plotkin created the <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/index.html">Glulx</a> game format. Glulx games can be much larger,
and can include sounds, graphics, and multiple sub-windows within the
main game window. Glulx games can be played on any modern personal
computer, since Glulx interpreters exist for Macintosh, Windows, and
Linux. However, Glulx games are mostly too large to play on cell phones
and other hand-held devices. Z-machine interpreters are available for
some popular hand-helds. (Frotz is available for the iPhone, for
instance.)</p>

<h3 id="writing-your-first-game">Writing Your First Game</h3>

<p>There are no rules at all that dictate what you can put in a game.
One of the great things about interactive fiction is that you’re free to
write whatever sort of story you’d like, and put whatever story elements
in it you think would be fun.</p>

<p>Your first game may be just something that you put together for fun,
or as a surprise for your kids. But if you hope to create a game that
you can share with other people, you may want to think carefully about
what people will be able to see and do when they play your game. Here
are a few tips that may help you come up with a better game. If these
tips don’t make sense now, come back to the list in a few weeks &ndash; it may
make more sense after you’ve done some writing.</p>

<ol class="num">
<li>Players won’t be able to read your mind. If you want them to know
about something (such as which directions they can go when they’re in a
certain room, or the fact that a time bomb is ticking), you need to
write some output text that will tell them. Output text is the material
that appears in double quotation marks within your source text.</li>
<li>When creating objects, always add all of the vocabulary words you can
think of that players might use to refer to the objects. (See <a
href="#adding-vocabulary-words-with-understand">Adding
Vocabulary Words</a> to learn how to
do this.)</li>
<li>When creating new actions that will work on your objects, always add
all of the verb synonyms you can think of. Forcing the player to guess
what verb you had in mind is considered extremely poor form. (The
techniques for <a href="#creating-new-actions">creating new actions</a> are explained in Chapter 4)</li>
<li>After writing a few paragraphs, click the Go button to compile your
game and test your work. Test all of the silly commands you can think
of, and watch how your game handles the commands. Then rewrite and test
some more. Don’t wait until you’ve written great swaths of source text
before compiling; failing to compile often is just a way to give
yourself lots of needless headaches.</li>
<li>Write an intro to your game (using a When Play Begins rule &ndash; see
<a href="#passing-time">Passing Time</a>) that gives players a
clear idea about two or three things: Where the story takes place, what
character they’re supposed to be, and what that character is trying to
do.</li>
<li>If you plan to have anyone outside your immediate circle of family
and friends play the game, you’ll want to enlist at least two
<a href="#Ref_beta-test">beta-testers</a>.
</li>
  </ol>

<p>Even before you write the first sentence of your story, Inform
contains a great mass of rules that will allow your game to do some
sophisticated things automatically. The game can, for instance,
construct sentences that you never wrote, in order to describe
situations that may come up during the story. The rules that are
included in I7 are called the <strong>Standard Rules</strong>. You can
use them without knowing anything about them. In fact, you will be using
them in every game, unless you explicitly switch some of them off. Just
about every rule in the library can be individually disabled (switched
off) if it produces results that you don’t want. Switching off portions
of the library is an advanced programming topic, but the basic technique
is illustrated in <a href="#Ref_new_rule_(replace)">Appendix C</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about what the Standard Rules look like, you can
open them from the Inform IDE. In the Macintosh, choose File &gt; Open
Extension &gt; Graham Nelson &gt; Standard Rules.</p>

<p>Please be careful not to make any changes in this file! If you do
accidentally make changes, be sure to close the file without saving.
Changing the Standard Rules could mess up Inform so that the games you
write won’t work properly, or at all. (If this happens, you can always
download and reinstall Inform. Reinstalling will not affect the game
you’re working on.)</p>

<h4 id="from-the-top">From the Top</h4>

<p>To start your game, you need to create at least one room, where the
story will start. Chapter 2 of this book is all about how to create
rooms. Before you start writing your first room, though, you may want to
do a couple of preliminary things. I recommend starting your game as
shown below. First, the game should have a title and a byline. (These
will be created automatically by Inform when you start a new project,
but you can change them at any time just by editing the first line in
the Source page.) After the title and byline, skip a line and write a
Use sentence, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use American dialect and the serial comma.`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use American dialect and the serial comma.</div></div>

<p>Inform was written by an Englishman, so it uses British spellings for
a few words unless you instruct otherwise. “Use American dialect”
switches the spelling from British to American. If you want the game to
start out in brief mode, do it this way:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use American dialect, brief room descriptions, and the serial
comma.</div></div>

<p>Prior to version 6E59, Inform’s default for room descriptions was
<span id="Ref_brief_mode" class="anchor"></span>brief mode, but the
default has been changed to verbose mode. Here’s the difference: When
the game is in verbose mode, the player will read the complete
description of each room each time she enters the room. If the game is
in brief mode, the room description will be printed out in full only the
first time the player enters a room; after that, the room name will be
printed more or less by itself. (Any movable objects or people in the
room will still be mentioned.) The player can switch full-length room
descriptions on and off using the VERBOSE and BRIEF commands, which are
built into Inform, so telling Inform that you want to use brief room
descriptions only controls how your game will start out, not what may
happen after that. If the solution of a puzzle relies on the game being
in verbose mode, but the player has switched to brief mode, you’ve
written an unfair puzzle! (Here’s a <strong>bonus tip</strong>: If the
room description has changed as a result of some action the player has
taken, and you want to make sure the player sees the new description,
make the room <em>unvisited</em> when the player takes that action. For
more on how to do this, see <a href="#when-is-a-room-visited">When Is a Room ‘Visited’?</a>.</p>

<p>The serial comma <span id="Ref_serial_comma" class="anchor"></span>is
the final comma in lists of items. If the serial comma is switched on,
your game might report this:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p>You can see an apple, a pear, and a banana here.</p>
</div>
<p>If the serial comma is <em>not</em> being used, the output is just
slightly different:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p>You can see an apple, a pear and a banana here.</p>
</div>
<p>Most games also need an introduction &ndash; some text that will “set the
stage” for the story. You can create an introduction by writing a When
Play Begins rule, perhaps something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\n\n\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">When play begins, say "Lord Triffid has invited you to spend your
week's vacation in his castle. Upon arriving, though, you begin to feel
a bit uneasy. Perhaps it's the bats flying in and out of the attic
window that put a damper on your mood, or perhaps it’s the sound of
barking, snarling guard dogs&hellip;"</div></div>

<h4 id="the-detail-trap">The Detail Trap</h4>

<p>When writing your first interactive fiction, there’s a pitfall you
may want to watch out for &ndash; the detail trap. Let’s suppose you want your
story to start in the kitchen of the main character’s house. So you
start putting things in the kitchen &ndash; appliances and so on. (By the way, <a href="../RB_6.html#section_5">RB 6.5: Kitchen and
Bathroom</a>, has some great tips on how to make appliances.) Now, a
kitchen is a complicated place! The stove can be switched on, and
touching it when it’s switched on will burn you. The hot and cold water
taps in the sink can also be turned on, and when one of them is on,
there’s some water that the player might want to interact with. In the
refrigerator is some moldy cheese, so you need to figure out how Inform
handles the smelling action.</p>

<p>And so on. Two months later, you’re still trying to work out the
details of a realistic kitchen. (What if the glass in the cupboard is
half-full of water instead of completely full? If you empty a half-full
glass on the floor will it only make a small puddle instead of a large
puddle?) Meanwhile, your story has gone nowhere, and your enthusiasm for
interactive fiction has taken a nosedive. That’s the detail trap.</p>

<p>A better approach, I’ve found, is to start by creating a bunch of
rooms and putting perhaps a couple of major scenery items in each room.
(Scenery is discussed in Chapter 2.) Then create a few simple puzzles.
Then add one or two important characters &ndash; but only in a basic way.
Don’t worry about the nuances of conversation yet. (Characters and
conversation are covered in Chapter 5.)</p>

<p>I like to write descriptions when I’m starting out, because I like to
get a concrete feeling for the places and objects in the story. To start
with, though, write basic descriptions of rooms and important objects
without worrying about how the objects may change during the course of
the game. You can always edit the descriptions later to allow them to
change dynamically, or to take account of details that are added to the
code later.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to learn in Inform. So start with simple things and
build up your game in an orderly way. Put off the complex and tricky
stuff for a later stage in the development.</p>

<h4 id="title-trickery">Title Trickery</h4>

<p>We’re going to take a little detour into more sophisticated Inform
programming here &ndash; nothing that’s tricky to write or understand, but
we’ll use a couple of Inform’s deeper features without bothering to
explain them. The reason we’re going to do it here is because of what
happens at the very beginning of the game.</p>


<p>After your intro, Inform will print the banner text. (Don’t confuse
the banner text, which is printed only once, with the status line, which
looks like a banner and usually runs across the top of the interpreter
window throughout the game.) If you’ve given your game a title and
subtitle, they’ll appear in the banner text, which might look something
like this:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">A Screw Loose</p>

<p>A Digital Dalliance by Jim Aikin</p>
<p>Release 1 / Serial number 150215 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
6/12N) SD</p>
</div>
<p>Wondering how to put a cool subhead underneath the game’s title, like
the one shown above? That text is called the story headline. You do it
like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The story headline is &quot;A Digital Dalliance&quot;.`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The story headline is "A Digital Dalliance".</div></div>

<p>Providing the release number, serial number, and so on as part of the
banner is not anything you need to set up; it’s done automatically, as a
courtesy to players. Among other things, it will help you keep track of
different versions of your game, if you release more than one version.
But there may be games in which displaying this text is not desirable.
You may want to replace the default banner text with your own text, or
suppress it entirely. To do this, you could add code like this near the
top of your game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the banner text: say "[bold type]I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay![roman type][line break][line break]"</div></div>

<p>Whatever you write as a rule for printing the banner text will be
printed out as the banner. Instead of using a “say” phrase as shown
above, you can write “do nothing” here, which will suppress the banner
text entirely. If you’re replacing the banner text, you might want to
include your own version number. (Inform’s version numbering doesn’t
allow decimal points, which makes it a bit nonstandard in the computer
world, so writing a banner text such as “A Screw Loose, version 1.01”
might be worth considering.)</p>

<p>Writing a new rule for printing the banner text, however, will
<em>also</em> change the banner text information when the player types
the VERSION command. The release number, serial number, build number,
and compiler number will be unavailable. This is less desirable. If you
want to suppress the banner text at the beginning of the game but keep
the information available in response to the VERSION command, you can do
it this way:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The display banner rule is not listed in the startup rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The display banner rule is not listed in the startup rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>This will eliminate the opening banner but leave the version
information intact, so the player will be able to display it with the
VERSION command. Substituting your own banner text when play begins
while keeping the existing text in response to the VERSION command is
possible but tricky, so we won’t get into it here.</p>

<p>Before we move on, we need to pause for a quick cautionary note: The
title of an Inform game can’t contain quotation marks. That is, if you
want your story’s title to be displayed this way:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p>“Repent,” Said the Tick-Tock Man</p>
</div>
<p>… you just plain can’t. You can, however, use single quotes
(apostrophes), producing this title:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p>‘Repent,’ Said the Tick-Tock Man</p>
</div>

<p>A problem that used to crop up more often has now been fixed. In some
previous versions of I7, it was impossible to use an apostrophe in the
title if the apostrophe fell at the end of a word. That is, you couldn’t
call your story “Goin’ Home”. This is now allowed. You can just type an
apostrophe at any point in the title, either in the middle of a word or
at the end, and it will be displayed properly.</p>

<h4 id="telling-a-story">Telling a Story</h4>

<p>Maybe the most basic way to look at a story &ndash; any story, be it
interactive, written on paper, or told out loud &ndash; is that a story is
about a person who has a <em>problem</em>. The reason for looking at
stories this way is simple: If the main character in the story doesn’t
have a problem, the story will be extremely boring. When we read a
story, we want to enjoy the suspense of wondering how the lead character
will solve the problem, and then at the end we want the satisfaction of
seeing how the problem was resolved. In interactive fiction, the player
usually <em>is</em> the lead character, which can add to the suspenseful
emotions your reader/players will feel.</p>


<p>The problem in a story can be as small as finding a lost kitten, or
as large as saving Earth from alien invaders. As long as the problem is
emotionally important to the lead character, it will work in a
story.</p>

<p>If the problem is too easily solved, the reader (or player) will feel
cheated. So the author needs to make sure the problem is not only
important to the character, but not too easy.</p>


<p>In interactive fiction, solving the main story problem usually means
solving a variety of puzzles. This <em>Handbook</em> has a whole chapter
(Chapter 6) on designing puzzles.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="whats-a-wip">
<h4>What’s a WIP?</h4>

<p>As you read discussion of interactive fiction programming in Internet
forums and newsgroups, you’ll often find somebody talking about “my
WIP.” This is an abbreviation for “work in progress.” Large games can be
“in progress” for months or years. As long as you’re still working on an
unfinished game, or even thinking about it once in a while, it’s a
WIP.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="managing-your-projects">Managing Your Project(s)</h3>

<p>It’s a good idea to always save your project to some specific folder
on your hard drive. In Windows, this would probably be My Documents &gt;
Inform &gt; Projects. If you care about your creative work (and you
should!), it’s a very good idea to <em>back up</em> your project to a
separate location after you’ve done any new work on it. USB memory
sticks are cheap and convenient. Always use a separate <em>physical</em>
location for backup, not just a different partition on the same physical
hard drive. The point of making a backup copy is to protect you against
the possibility of a hard drive crash or system failure.</p>


<p>Every few days, I like to save a project using a new, numbered
filename. After working on Flustered Duck 05 for a few days, I’ll use
the Save As command and save the project as Flustered Duck 06, and so
on. (The final release version of “A Flustered Duck” was project version
21). Here’s why that’s a good idea: If you should change your mind about
a design decision that you’ve made, or if you should accidentally delete
or change something without meaning to, you can open up an older version
of your project and copy a portion of the source code from the old
version into the new one. Doing this actually saved me from a serious
problem when I was writing this <em>Handbook.</em> I recommend it
highly.</p>

<h3 id="about-inform-source-code">About Inform Source Code</h3>

<p>One of the strong attractions of Inform 7 for new authors who would
like to try writing IF is its use of natural language syntax. In many
simple situations, both writing Inform source code and reading it is
easier than wrapping your brains around a more conventionally structured
programming language (such as TADS 3 or Javascript). Unfortunately,
there’s a downside to this apparent ease of use, which will become more
apparent as you get deeper into writing your game. Inform’s programming
language contains a lot of one-off syntax &ndash; phrases that make sense if
you know them, but that are hard to guess if you don’t know them. If you
can’t remember how a given line should be written, your game probably
won’t compile, and the compiler’s error message may not be very helpful.
And if you can’t remember the phrase to use, searching the Documentation
for it may not work either.</p>

<h3 id="all-about-bugs">All About Bugs</h3>

<p>When a computer program doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do, it
either does the wrong thing or, worse, stops working entirely. This type
of problem is referred to as a <em>bug</em>. According to legend, one
day the scientists who were trying to use one of the very earliest
computers kept getting mysterious errors. After hours of frustration,
somebody thought of opening the box of circuits and looking inside. A
dead moth was lying on a circuit board, making an electrical connection
where no connection was supposed to be. After that, the scientists
started saying that any mysterious behavior in their programs was caused
by “a bug.”</p>

<p>Finding and fixing bugs is a huge
part of computer programming. Fortunately, most of the bugs you’ll run
into don’t involve dead insects! (Although that might make an
interesting puzzle&hellip;) Most bugs today are caused by errors in the
instructions (the source code) that the computer is trying to run.</p>


<p>We all write source code that has bugs, so you may as well get used
to it. Most bugs are easily found and easily fixed. A few of them may
drive you crazy for hours at a time. It’s all part of the process.</p>

<p>Inform bugs come in four different varieties.</p>

<p>When you click the Go! button to tell Inform to compile your source
code into a game, the compiler may encounter errors. You may have
written things that Inform doesn’t understand. Instead of producing a
game, Inform will print out an error message, or a bunch of them.
Usually these messages will give you a pretty good idea what you need to
fix &ndash; but sometimes the compiler can’t quite guess what the real problem
is, so you may need to try a bunch of changes until you find something
that works.</p>


<p>In the second type of bug, when you click the Go! button, your game
may compile successfully and appear in the right-hand window, ready for
you to try out. But the game may not behave in the way you expect. An
object that you meant to put in plain sight in a room might not be
anywhere in the game, for example. Inform can’t find these bugs for you.
The only way to find them is by testing and retesting your game while
writing it. Try out a bunch of different commands, including silly ones,
just to see what happens. (This is called “trying to break it.”)</p>

<p>The third type of bug is called a “run-time error.” In a run-time
error, your game tries to do something that it can’t do. Instead of
producing some type of normal output, the game will produce an error
message. Run-time errors can happen, for instance, when your code tries
to refer to an object that doesn’t happen to exist. When you run into a
run-time error, look closely at the error message in the game panel, and
then at the code that is being used by the command that triggered the
error.</p>


<p>The biggest run-time errors
are those that cause the game to freeze or quit unexpectedly.
Fortunately, these are fairly rare. But don’t be surprised if it happens
&ndash; just go back to the code that was being run in response to your last
command. Nine times out of ten, that’s where the problem will be
found.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble finding a bug, a useful technique is to
“comment out” a section of your source code that you think might be
causing the problem. In Inform, comments are surrounded by square
brackets [like this]. Any text that is within square brackets will be
ignored by the compiler &ndash; unless it’s within double-quotes. Within
quotes, square brackets have a different purpose, as explained in <a href="#text-insertions">Text Insertions</a>.</p>


<p>By commenting out blocks of code, you can test a game both with and
without selected features. This will help isolate a trouble spot.</p>

<p>The fourth type of bug can look like any of the first three. Because
Inform itself is still being developed, the compiler undoubtedly has a
few bugs of its own. If you encounter something weird when you seem to
be doing everything right, it could be a compiler bug. 97% of the time
it won’t be &ndash; it will be your code. But compiler bugs do exist. If you
should run into something that looks like a compiler bug, your first
step should to post a message to the intfiction.org forum asking for
confirmation of what you’ve found. If it is indeed a compiler bug,
you’ll want to file a bug report. The <a
href="http://inform7.com/">Inform website</a>
has instructions on how to do this. There is also a <a href="https://inform7.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/I7/issues">bug tracker website</a>
where you can check whether a given bug has already been filed. If not,
you can file a report and keep an eye on it. You can also check here to
discover what other bugs you’ll need to be aware of while writing. Most
of them are relatively obscure and shouldn’t cause you any trouble, but
some are worth knowing about.</p>

<h3 id="testing-your-game">Testing Your Game</h3>

<p>Testing a game, or any other piece of software, happens in two
stages. In the first (alpha) stage, you test your work as you’re
developing it. The best way to do this is to write the game one small
piece at a time. For instance, when you add a couple of new rooms (as
explained in Chapter 2), click the Go! button to run the game and try
walking back and forth from the new rooms to the rooms that were already
in place. Even with something as simple as adding rooms, it’s possible
to make a mistake in the compass directions or inadvertently create a
room when you think you’re creating a door, so you need to test your
work.</p>


<p>If you add a dozen rooms, a dozen pieces of scenery, and a machine
the player can operate and <em>then</em> run the game, you’re far more
likely to miss a bug than if you test a little bit at a time. Worse, you
may find yourself staring at a screen full of compiler error messages
and have to spend an hour figuring out where your work went astray.</p>

<p>But even when you test as
thoroughly as you possibly can while developing the game, you will miss
dozens of awful bugs. This is a promise.</p>


<p><span id="Ref_beta-test" class="anchor"></span>In the second (beta)
stage of testing, you enlist the aid of a few industrious volunteers,
who <em>beta-test</em> your game before it’s released and send you
reports of any bugs they spot. Good beta-testing won’t transform an
awful game into a great one, but it can definitely turn an awful game
into an okay game, or turn a decent game with deep problems into a great
game. (But only if you fix the issues that your testers find. That goes
without saying.)</p>

<p>Always thank your beta-testers for sending you their bug reports! And
even if you think they’re wrong, don’t argue with them. Like everyone
else who plays your game, they’re entitled to an opinion, and even from
a wrong-headed opinion, you may be able learn useful lessons.</p>


<p>Encourage your testers to use Inform’s handy transcript feature (not
to be confused with the Transcript in the Inform IDE). At the beginning
of each play session, they should type the command TRANSCRIPT. This will
open a file dialog box in which they’ll be able to specify a name for a
script (.scr or .log) file. This file will capture everything that
happens in the play session. They can then attach the transcript file to
an email and send it to you. In effect, you’ll be able to “watch over
their shoulder” while they play the game. This is incredibly useful &ndash;
you’ll learn a lot about what commands they try to use and what objects
they’re interested in examining.</p>

<p>Note that this feature doesn’t work in the Inform IDE. It only works
when the game is loaded into a separate interpreter.</p>


<p>Some IF interpreter software may wipe out a running transcript if
your game ever clears the screen. If you employ screen-clearing for
dramatic purposes between scenes, you need to test what happens in
several interpreters (and if possible on both Mac and Windows
interpreters) before sending the game to your testers. Or ask them to
test it, and tell them how to do so.</p>

<p>Traditionally, IF beta-testers include comments in their transcript
by starting a command line with an asterisk. For instance, you might
find a line in the transcript that reads like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>* The room description mentions the vase on the pedestal, but I
already broke the vase.</div>
</div>

<p>By default, Inform will respond to a line like this by saying,
“That’s not a verb I recognize.” While not an actual problem, this
message soon gets annoying, since the tester is, after all, doing
something sensible &ndash; namely, giving you a comment. What we’d like would
be for Inform to respond with something like, “Comment noted.”
Fortunately, this is easy to fix. Copy the following code into your
  game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Commenting is an action out of world applying to one topic. Understand &quot;* [text]&quot; as commenting.\n\nCarry out commenting:\n\tsay &quot;Comment noted.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Commenting is an action out of world applying to one topic. Understand "* [text]" as commenting.</div>
<div class="codeline"></div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out commenting:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Comment noted."</div>
</div>
<p>The details of this code (the definition of the action and the use of
a Carry Out rule) are covered in Chapter 4. A slightly more flexible way
to get the same result is shown in Example 403, “Alpha,” in the
Documentation. However, the regular expression matching used in that
example doesn’t match the asterisk character. To allow the tester to use
asterisks, as shown above, we would need to edit the code in the example
slightly, like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command (this is the ignore beta-comments rule): \n\tif the player&apos;s command matches the regular expression &quot;^\p&quot; or the player&apos;s command matches the regular expression &quot;^\*&quot;: \n\t\tsay &quot;(Noted.)&quot;; \n\t\treject the player&apos;s command.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command (this is the ignore beta-comments rule): </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player's command matches the regular expression "^\p" or the player's command matches the regular expression "^\*": </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "(Noted.)"; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;reject the player's command.</div>
</div>

<p>With this code in place, your testers can flag their comments with a
*, !, ?, or : (or, for that matter, a ??? or !!!), either in a way that
signals what type of comment they’re making, or just for fun.</p>


<h3 id="using-the-debugging-commands">Using the Debugging Commands</h3>

<p>Inform includes a good set of commands that can be used for speeding
up your testing process and tracking down bugs in your game. These
commands are available only during the development process; when you
release your finished game, other players won’t be able to use them.
These commands don’t actually find bugs; what they do is help you see
what’s going on in your game while it’s running, and/or take shortcuts
that will speed up the testing process.</p>

<p>The commands you can use while your game is running in the Inform IDE
include ACTIONS, RULES, PURLOIN, GONEAR, and SHOWME. Also, for testing a
series of commands quickly, you can write a TEST ME script. The Replay
button can be used to rerun your most recent sequence of commands, which
is a very useful way to find out if you’ve succeeded in fixing a problem
that you had in the last run-through. The Skein window contains all of
your earlier run-throughs, and you can use it to replay just about any
series of commands you used earlier.</p>

<p>With the PURLOIN command, you can instantly “grab” any object in your
model world. Objects in distant rooms and locked containers can be
purloined &ndash; and you can also purloin things that can’t be picked up at
all in the ordinary way, such as people and scenery. There’s no reason
to purloin people or scenery, other than for fun. But by purloining the
rusty iron key that’s hidden in the oak cask in the wine cellar, you can
quickly test whether the key works to unlock the door of the princess’s
chamber. You don’t need to go down to the wine cellar and break open the
cask; just PURLOIN the key.</p>

<p>The GONEAR command provides instant transportation to any location in
your game. With a large game, one that includes dozens of rooms, GONEAR
will save you hours of work. Just pick an item of scenery in the room
you want to be transported to, and GONEAR the scenery item.</p>

<p>When using PURLOIN and GONEAR to bypass part of the process that your
players will go through, you need to be aware that you can get the game
into an unusual state &ndash; a state that your players will never encounter.
On rare occasions this can lead you to think your code has a bug that
isn’t there at all. For instance, let’s suppose you’ve programmed a
ghost to follow the player around the haunted castle. If you use GONEAR
to pass magically through a locked door, the ghost quite likely won’t be
able to follow you.</p>

<p>The
ACTIONS command causes Inform to print out the action that’s being
triggered when you type a command. This can be useful if you aren’t
getting the results you expect from a command.</p>

<p>The SHOWME command (see <a href="../WI_2.html#section_7">WI 2.7: the SHOWME command</a>) prints out the current state of any object in the
model world. SHOWME SHOES, for instance, will print out all of the data
associated with the shoes object. When you start writing objects that
can get into several different states (for instance, a goblet of wine
that can be poisonous or safe), you can use SHOWME GOBLET after dropping
the tablets into the goblet to see if the goblet has switched to the
state that it’s supposed to.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="../WI_11#section_4">WI 11.4: the showme phrase</a>, the word showme can be used to add
debugging code to your game. When the game is running, if a line with a
showme phrase is reached, you’ll see a message in the game window giving
whatever information you’ve put in the phrase. I’m not convinced that
this is very useful, however. A better method is described on <a href="../WI_2.html#section_7">WI 2.9: Material not for release</a>. After marking a section of
your code as not for release, you can put anything you like in that
section, secure in the knowledge that it will be available only to you
(and to your testers, if you choose). For example, if the hunger of the
player character is a numerical value that changes during the game, and
you want to keep an eye on it, do this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Section - Not for Release\n\nEvery turn:\n\tsay &quot;The hunger of the player is now [hunger of the player].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Section - Not for Release</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The hunger of the player is now [hunger of the player]."</div>
</div>
<p>It’s not always convenient to put this type of game-state monitoring
printout code in its own section, however. Another technique is
suggested below, in the section “Another Way to Debug.”</p>

<p>More about commands you can use within the game panel while testing
your work: If you’re using scenes in your game (see Chapter 7), the
SCENES command can be used to show which scenes are currently
running.</p>

<p>The TEST ME command (see  <a href="../WI_2.html#section_8">WI 2.8: the TEST command</a>) gives you a quick way to run through
a series of commands. To start with, define the series of commands you
want to use in your game, like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Test me with &quot;open suitcase / unlock suitcase with rusty key / open\nsuitcase / search suitcase / take dynamite / light match / light dynamite with match / z / z / z&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Test me with "open suitcase / unlock suitcase with rusty key / open</div>
<div class="codeline">suitcase / search suitcase / take dynamite / light match / light dynamite with match / z / z / z".</div>
</div>
<p>After compiling your game, when you type TEST ME the game will
automatically run through this entire sequence of commands, in order.
When you’re testing complex puzzles over and over, this will save you
lots of typing. The word “me” is used a lot (probably because it’s
reminiscent of a scene in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>), but it’s not
necessary. You could just as easily do it this way, writing two or more
separate tests and then, if you like, writing a TEST ME command that
nests some or all of the other tests:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Test suitcase with &quot;open suitcase / unlock suitcase with rusty key / open suitcase / search suitcase&quot;.\nTest dynamite with &quot;take dynamite / light match / light dynamite with match / z / z / z&quot;.\nTest me with &quot;test suitcase / test dynamite&quot;.\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Test suitcase with "open suitcase / unlock suitcase with rusty key / open suitcase / search suitcase".</div>
<div class="codeline">Test dynamite with "take dynamite / light match / light dynamite with match / z / z / z".</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with "test suitcase / test dynamite".</div>
    
</div>
<p>Now the commands TEST SUITCASE and TEST DYNAMITE can be used
independently, or they can be combined by typing TEST ME.</p>

<p>The RULES command can be used while testing your game to find out
what rules Inform is using to process other commands. This is a fairly
advanced technique &ndash; the first few times you try it you may not
understand what you’re seeing &ndash; but it can sometimes be very useful. If
the game is producing an output that you don’t want, you may be able to
figure out what rule is producing that output by using RULES and then
trying the command that isn’t working correctly. Most often, the last
rule that is displayed before the offending output text is the rule
that’s producing the text.</p>


<h3 id="another-way-to-debug">Another Way to Debug</h3>

<p>One of the easiest traditional ways to debug a computer program is to
add print statements. A print statement (which in Inform would be in the
form of a “say” statement) prints a text output to the screen. You can
put whatever you want in a print statement. For instance, you could do
something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To demolish the dungeon:\n\tsay &quot;Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code.&quot;;\n\t[other lines of code would go here...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To demolish the dungeon:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[other lines of code would go here&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>The “say” line doesn’t do anything in your game; it just enables you
to test that your code is actually running the “demolish the dungeon”
routine when you think it’s supposed to.</p>

<p>Rather than just print out a bare “now this is happening” statement,
you could write a testing “say” line that would give you specific
information about other things that are going on in the game. Let’s
suppose, for instance, that you want the dungeon to be demolished only
if the player is carrying the detonator &ndash; but for some reason it appears
that the player is able to demolish the dungeon even while not carrying
the detonator. In that case, you might want to check the player’s
inventory while printing out your debugging message:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To demolish the dungeon:\n\tsay &quot;Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code. The player is currently carrying [a list of things carried by the player].&quot;;\n\t[other lines of code would go here...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To demolish the dungeon:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code. The player is currently carrying [a list of things carried by the player].";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[other lines of code would go here&hellip;]</div>
</div>
<p>The thing to be careful of with this technique is that you might
accidentally leave a debugging print statement in the released version
of your game. Erik Temple has suggested a neat way to dodge this danger,
however. This uses a bit of inserted Inform 6 code, an advanced
technique that is mentioned only briefly in this <em>Handbook,</em> (see
<a href="#what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What does Inform 6 have to do with Inform 7</a>). But
since we’re on the topic of debugging, here’s how to do it. First, add
the following lines to your game, entering them carefully (the spaces
are important):</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use inline debugging.\n\nUse inline debugging translates as (- Constant INLINE_DEBUG; -)\n\t\nTo #if utilizing inline debugging:\n\t(- #ifdef INLINE_DEBUG; -)\n\t\nTo #end if:\n\t(- #endif; -)\n\t\nTo debug (T - a text):\n\t#if utilizing inline debugging;\n\tsay T;\n\t#end if.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use inline debugging.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Use inline debugging translates as (- Constant INLINE_DEBUG; -)</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To #if utilizing inline debugging:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(- #ifdef INLINE_DEBUG; -)</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To #end if:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(- #endif; -)</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To debug (T - a text):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;#if utilizing inline debugging;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say T;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;#end if.</div>
</div>

<div class="addendum"><div class="add-header">Addendum</div><div class="add-body">This cannot work in 10.1, which won't allow an I6 inclusion to have an #ifdef without an #endif.</div></div>

<p>Having done this, you can now write any debugging print statements
that you add to your game’s code like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\tdebug “--Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code. The player is currently carrying [a list of things carried by the player].]&quot;;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;debug “--Now entering the dungeon-demolishing code. The player is currently carrying [a list of things carried by the player].]";</div>
</div>
<p>The lines beginning with # can be used to do other things besides
saying texts, though this is probably less useful. For instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of jumping:\n\tsay &quot;You jumped!&quot;;\n\t#if utilizing inline debugging;\n\tnow the player carries the rutabaga;\n\t#end if.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of jumping:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You jumped!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;#if utilizing inline debugging;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the rutabaga;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;#end if.</div>
</div>
<p>You might use this technique as a tricky way of resetting in-game
objects (such as a locked door) to a desired state in order to test them
repeatedly.</p>

<p>When you’re done debugging and ready to release your game, simply
comment out the line “Use inline debugging” before compiling for
release, and all of the debug code will disappear from the released
version of the game.</p>

<h3 id="puzzles">Puzzles</h3>

<p>Let’s be frank: This <em>Handbook</em> is not going to tell you
everything you might want to know about writing puzzles. For one thing,
clever authors keep dreaming up new possibilities! But puzzles are such
a big part of interactive fiction that a book on how to write IF using
Inform can’t neglect them entirely.</p>

<p>A few works of IF have been written that have no puzzles. In a work
of this sort, the player wanders around, looking at things and/or
conversing with characters, but there are no obstacles to movement or
action. The whole of the story is available, and no special smarts or
problem-solving are needed to read it. At one time there was a
competition, the IF Art Show, dedicated to this type of game.</p>

<p>Even in a story with no actual puzzles, the player may be able to
make choices. These choices may affect the outcome of the story: The
author might write five or six branching story lines, and the player
might have to play the game a number of times to be sure of not missing
anything important, or to understand what the author had in mind. But if
the story is free of puzzles, we would expect that any of the choices
would be easy to find. It would be easy to move down any of the branches
of the story.</p>

<p>In most IF, though, the player has to exercise some brain power to do
things that will move the story forward. The player who can’t figure out
what to do next is <em>stuck.</em> A player who is stuck can wander
around in the world of the story for an hour, trying things that don’t
produce any results and getting more and more frustrated.</p>

<p>When the player does figure out how to solve a puzzle, there is
usually a reward of some kind. A new object might become available
(something the player will need to attack another puzzle), a new
treasure be discovered, and a new room or region of the map open up. In
games that keep score (see Chapter 7), the player should earn points for
solving each puzzle. You may want to set up a scoring system that will
award more points for solving the most difficult puzzles, and fewer
points for solving the easier ones. Of course, players may not agree
with you about which puzzles are easy and which are hard!</p>

<p>For details on the types of puzzles you’re likely to find when
playing IF, or likely to want to implement, see Chapter 6,
“Puzzles.”</p>

<h3 id="extensions-for-inform">Extensions for Inform</h3>

<p>A number of people in the Inform 7 community (which exists almost
entirely on the Internet, though local meet-ups have popped up here and
there) have written <em>extensions</em> for Inform. An extension is a
file containing code that can be used by authors to do something
specific &ndash; something that’s not included in the standard version of
Inform.</p>

<p>There are extensions for creating tricky kinds of objects, such as
liquids and secret doors; for producing smoother and more interesting
conversations between the player character (PC) and non-player
characters (NPCs); for constructing menus of hints that your players can
consult; and for many other purposes.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/extensions.jpg"></div>

<p>Extensions are written using
the Inform programming language &ndash; so technically, an extension can’t do
anything you couldn’t do yourself. But most of them were written by
experts, they have been tested and debugged, and they come with
documentation that tells how to use them. So why spend a week working
out how to do something tricky when you can download an extension and
have it working in half an hour?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as of 2015 the situation with respect to extensions
has become a bit disorganized and confusing. It was formerly the case
that all extensions could be downloaded from the Extensions page of the
Inform 7 website. But most of the material on this page is now obsolete. It’s useful to
have access to the older extensions if you’re running an older version
of Inform for some reason, so there’s a reason to keep this material
available. But in versions 6L02 and 6L38, some basic things in the
Inform programming language have changed. As a result, many of the older
extensions won’t run in the new versions of Inform. If you try to
include one, the compiler will issue an error message. Bottom line:
Unless you know what you’re doing, do not attempt to download extensions
  one at a time manually from the Inform website.</p>

<div class="addendum">I wish I could tell you that as of 2022 it's no longer confusing.</div>

<p>Some authors have updated their extensions to work with the new
version, but others haven’t. If you want the features in an extension
that hasn’t been updated, you may possibly be able to fix the problems
yourself; Appendix B of the <em>Handbook</em> provides a few details on
how to attempt this.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Inform authoring, you can avoid much of the
confusion. After downloading and installing the Inform program, switch
to the Extensions page in the program, click the Public Library header,
and scroll to the bottom of the page, as shown at right. You’ll see a
yellow DOWNLOAD EXTENSIONS button; the number may be larger than 76, as
more extensions are added to the library. Click this button. Inform will
download the extensions and install them for you, and you’ll be ready to
go.</p>

<p>Once the extensions have downloaded, the documentation for each
extension will now be available under the Home button in the Extensions
page of the Inform program. You’ll find that the extensions are listed
alphabetically by the first name of the author.</p>

<p>If you’re upgrading to Inform 6L38 (or a later version) from an
earlier version and you already have some extensions installed, you’ll
need to use a slightly more complex process. Basically, you need to drag
your old folder of extensions off somewhere, so that Inform won’t be
able to find it. In Windows, the usual location for this folder is My
Documents/Inform. In the MacOS, it will be in the Library folder in your
folder in Users (for instance, Users/jimaikin/Library/Inform). However,
the MacOS tends to want to hide this Library folder from users. If you
can’t find it, open a Terminal window. Type this line (carefully) and
hit Return:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`chflags nohidden ~/Library/`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>
  <div class="codeline">chflags nohidden ~/Library/</div>
</div>

<p>This code will make the Library folder show up. Please don’t make any
other changes in the Library! Once you’ve deleted the Extensions folder
from Library/Inform, you can use the Download Extensions button as
described earlier.</p>

<p>Once your new extensions are installed, using one of them in your
game is easy. Near the top of your source code, just below the name of
the game and the author byline, enter a line like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Notepad by Jim Aikin.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Include Notepad by Jim Aikin.</div>
</div>
<p>This format is required: You have to give the name of the author, and
you can’t put a comma after the name of the extension.</p>

<p>It’s possible to open extension in a new window in the Inform IDE and
edit the code just the way you would any other Inform code. I recommend
that you not do this. Until you become an Inform power user, it’s far
too easy to create messy problems by editing an extension. If you want
to try editing an extension &ndash; for instance, because you think it has a
bug in it &ndash; make a backup copy of it first by copying the file and
pasting it to a new folder on your hard drive. That way, if you don’t
get the results you’re expecting, you can restore the original version
without needing to download it again.</p>

<p>Some extensions use other extensions. If extension A uses extension B
(by including it, as shown above) but extension B has been updated more
recently than extension A, extension A may now be broken. In this type
of situation, your best bet is to report the problem, either in the
intfiction.org forum or directly to the extension author.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-learn-more">Where to Learn More</h3>

<p>Once you’ve started writing with Inform, you’ll find the built-in
Documentation extremely useful. Pages in the Documentation that may not
have made much sense to begin with will turn out, after a month or two,
to be very clearly written and easy to understand. In particular, the
more than 400 Examples are a huge resource &ndash; but to get the most out of
them, you’ll need to study the code line by line. The explanations that
are included in the Examples are often brief and don’t mention
interesting features. After reading portions of the Documentation,
you’ll find the Search field in the IDE more and more useful. By typing
a half-remembered phrase (such as “something new”), you can quickly
locate a page that has the information you need.</p>

<p>If &ndash; no, make that “when” &ndash; you have questions about how to use
Inform, you’ll find the forum at intfiction.org a tremendous resource.
If you post a question there, you’ll probably be able to read an answer
posted by an Inform expert within a few hours &ndash; or at worst, the next
morning.</p>

<p>To get the most out of the forum, a few simple procedures will
help:</p>

<ol class="num" list-item="1">
<li>
Post your question in the <a href="https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/inform-7/19">Inform 7 subcategory</a> of the forum. Inform 7 is
not the only programming system discussed in the forum, and you want to
guide the right people to your post by making it clear what system
you’re using.</li>
<li>Describe your problem as clearly as you can. Questions that are
rambling or confusing will be less likely to lead to helpful responses
than questions that are clear and concise.</li>
<li>Before posting, try to create a very short example game (no longer
than 20 lines) that shows the problem you’re having. This will make it
easier for the experts to see what you’re doing wrong &ndash; and in the
process of creating the example game, you may figure out how to solve
the problem yourself! (It often works that way, in my experience.)
</li>

<h2 id="chapter-2-rooms-scenery">Chapter 2: Rooms &amp; Scenery</h2>

<p>As explained in Chapter 1 (see <a
href="#what-happens-in-a-game">What Happens in a Game</a>), the model world in which your
story takes place will be divided neatly into rooms. For the purposes of
IF, a “room” might be not a kitchen or living room but a football field
or a phone booth.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The same word is used in each case.
Some people feel that the word “room” is misleading, but we have to call
the places where things happen by some name or other, and the word
“room” has been used for this purpose for a long time.</p>

<p>Although the characters (including the player) can travel from room
to room, for most purposes other than travel we can think of each room
as a sealed box. When the player is in a given room, she will be able to
see, touch, and use the things that are in that room. But everything in
every other room will be invisible and out of reach. In fact, if the
player tries to refer to something that’s not in the current room, the
parser (the software in the game engine that interprets what the player
types) will usually pretend that the object the player referred to
doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>This is usually what’s needed in a game, but sometimes having a room
operate like a sealed container won’t give you the results you’re hoping
for. If the “room” is a tree limb high in a tree, for example, when the
player drops something we would expect it not to land on the limb.
Rather, it should fall to the forest floor far below.</p>

<p>You’ll find that there are two or three ways to work around the
limitations imposed by the sealed-room metaphor. If the player is at the
north end of an open field, for instance, you may want him to be able to
see (but not touch) the things that are at the south end of the field.
Later in this chapter, in the section <a href="#the-great-outdoors">The Great Outdoors</a>, we’ll
suggest some ways to do this. There are also some exceptions that come
into play when you’re designing a conversation system to let the player
talk to other characters: You can easily allow ASK BOB ABOUT THE JEWELS
to work as expected even if the jewels themselves are not in the room.
(The techniques for doing this are explained in Chapters 4 and 5 &ndash; see
<a href="#actions-with-topics">Actions with Topics</a> and <a
href="#topics-of-conversation">Topics of Conversation</a>.) In most situations, though, an
object has to be in the room with the player in order for the player to
do anything with it or even see it.</p>

<p>This concept is one of the most basic in interactive fiction. It’s
called <em>scope.</em> <span id="Ref_scope" class="anchor"></span>An
object is “in scope” if the player character can see and/or touch it;
otherwise it’s “not in scope.” The parser is responsible for enforcing
the rules of scope. If the parser pretends not to know about a given
object when the player refers to it, it’s because the object is not in
scope. This will most likely happen because the object is in a different
room. But it can also happen because the object is in a closed container
in the room. If the room is dark, the object might be in the room but
not available for the player to interact with. If the player character
is tied to a chair, things in the room may be visible (that is, in scope
for purposes of the EXAMINE command) but not touchable. Enforcing the
proper limitations on player interaction is partly handled by Inform,
but as your story becomes more complex you may find that you need to
handle some of the more awkward situations yourself.</p>

<p>By convention, everything in a room is assumed to be equally within
reach of the player character, with a couple of exceptions. As we’ll see
in Chapter 3, objects can be placed in locations that are out of reach,
so that the player can look at them but not touch them. In addition, the
player character may be seated on a chair or lying in a hammock in the
room, in which case she will have to STAND UP before interacting with
objects. In general, though, rooms have three standard characteristics:
Everything in the room is equally available for examining, touching, or
other manipulation; the player character is not facing any particular
direction; and things that are dropped end up on the floor. All of these
conventions can be changed, but experienced IF players will take them
for granted, and there’s usually no need to concern yourself with them &ndash;
especially not when writing your first game.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-first-room">Creating Your First Room</h3>

<p>Every Inform game has to have at least one room. Creating a room is
easy; you do it like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest Path is a room.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest Path is a room.</div>
</div>

<p>This
simple sentence produces an entire Inform game (though not a very
interesting one). If you create a new game, type this sentence into the
Source, and compile the game by clicking the Go button, you’ll find
yourself in a (featureless) room called Forest Path.</p>

<p>It’s usually a good idea to capitalize the words in each room name.
This is not required, it’s just a good habit to get into because it will
produce a more professional-looking game. You can add “The” before the
room name if you like. Inform will normally strip out the “The” before
printing the room name in the game’s output, so a room you call The
Forest Path will appear in the game as Forest Path. You can override
this if you want to, though, using the <strong>printed name</strong>
property, like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The printed name of the Forest Path is “The Forest Path”.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The printed name of the Forest Path is “The Forest Path”.</div>
</div>
<p>Notice the punctuation in that sentence: The period is
<em>outside</em> the quotation mark, not inside. This is important. When
Inform sees a period just before a close-quote, it will usually add an
extra blank line in the game’s output each time it prints the text. This
won’t happen when a room name is displayed &ndash; but even so, having room
names that end with periods would be rather ugly. With a room name,
putting the period outside the close-quote is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>You’ll almost always want to give each room its own
<strong>description</strong>, to give the player some idea where she is.
The description is text to be printed out, so you write it in
double-quotes, like this, putting the description immediately after the
sentence in which we created the room:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you.”</div>
</div>
<p>The first sentence creates a room called Forest Path. The second
sentence, in quotes, is the description of the room. If you put the
description immediately after the sentence that creates the room, Inform
will know that it’s the description; you don’t need to do anything
specific to tell Inform that the second sentence is the room
description. (This bit of streamlined coding does <em>not</em> apply to
other objects, as you’ll learn in the next chapter.)</p>

<p>If you’ve put something else between the sentence that creates the
room and the description, however, you need to tell Inform what you’re
doing. This won’t work:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest Path is a room. The printed name of Forest Path is &quot;The Forest Path.&quot; &quot;Tall old trees surround you.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest Path is a room. The printed name of Forest Path is "The Forest Path." "Tall old trees surround you."</div>
</div>

<p>Instead, you need to do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest Path is a room. The printed name of Forest Path is &quot;The Forest Path.&quot; The description is &quot;Tall old trees surround you.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest Path is a room. The printed name of Forest Path is "The Forest Path." The description is "Tall old trees surround you."</div>
</div>

<p>A room description can be as long or short as you like. It always has
to end with a period (or with a question mark or exclamation point,
though those aren’t used much in room descriptions.) In this case we
want the period <em>inside</em> the quotation mark, because we want
Inform to put a blank line after the description and before whatever is
printed next.</p>

<p>In describing the room, you’ll almost always find yourself mentioning
things that can be seen in the room. They may be important to the story,
or they may be there simply to add color and atmosphere. The things that
are mentioned in the room description are <em>scenery</em>.</p>

<p>In general, it’s a very good idea to add a separate scenery object
(see the next section) for each thing that’s mentioned in a room
description. The people who play your game don’t start out knowing
what’s important in the story and what’s irrelevant, so players usually
run around examining any object that’s mentioned in the game’s output &ndash;
or trying to examine it. If the player tries to examine something that
isn’t in scope, the parser will respond, “You can’t see any such thing.”
If the thing has just been mentioned in the room description, this
message is annoying, and your players will soon decide you’re not trying
very hard. Imagine this situation in a game:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Forest Path</p>
<p>Tall old trees surround you.</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x trees</div>
<p>You can’t see any such thing.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early days of interactive fiction, this type of response was
considered normal, but at that time computers had much less memory. Game
authors had to make the most of a tiny amount of text and a very small
number of objects, so none could be wasted on irrelevant scenery. Today,
failing to put the scenery into your rooms is considered poor form. In
the next section of this chapter, we’ll look at how to add scenery.</p>

<p>It’s important to write room descriptions that give players a clear
idea which directions are available for travel. That is, if the player
can travel east, northeast, or west to reach other rooms, the room
description should mention these directions and perhaps give some vague
idea what lies in that direction:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Forest Path</p>

<p>Tall old trees surround you. The path runs roughly north and south
from here, and a little side path runs off through the bushes to the
northeast.</p>
</div>

<p>Failing to mention exits in the room description was used as a puzzle
in some early games, but today this type of thing is generally
considered rude and crude. Fortunately, there are extensions (such as
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Exit%20Lister-v11.i7x">Exit Lister by Eric Eve</a>) that will put the room’s exits into the status
line at the top of the game window. Using Exit Lister or something
similar is a nice courtesy &ndash; but I feel it’s still a good idea to write
a room description that describes all of the exits in a clear way
(unless one of them is hidden as a puzzle). Exit Lister also provides a
utility command for the player, EXITS, which will list the available
exits to refresh the player’s memory.</p>

<p>Inform’s routines for printing out room descriptions are actually
quite complex. After printing out the description you write, Inform will
automatically mention anything in the room that it considers interesting
&ndash; mainly people and visible objects (but not scenery; Inform assumes
that the scenery needn’t be mentioned separately, presumably because
you’ve already mentioned it in the room description). If you’ve added an
object called a large toad to the room, Inform will know to mention it
like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">The Forest Path</p>
<p>Tall old trees surround you.</p>
<p>You can see a large toad here.</p>
</div>

<p>Inform uses certain rules for deciding how (or whether) to mention
these things. If you want to customize the way room descriptions are
printed out, see “Room Descriptions” at the end of this chapter.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="footnote">

<div class="sidebar" id="how-not-to-describe-a-room">
<h4>How Not to Describe a Room</h4>

<p>When writing room descriptions, there are two traps to watch out for.
First, try to avoid starting every room description with “You are in&hellip;”
or “You are standing in&hellip;”. This gets boring very quickly. Just
describe the setting. Second, avoid describing the room as if the player
has just arrived from any particular direction, or is facing any
particular direction. As you’re first writing the game, you may
naturally tend to assume that the player has arrived in the dining room
from the front hall &ndash; but later in the game, the player may arrive in
the dining room by returning from the kitchen. A good room description
will give the same impression no matter where the player arrived
from.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidebar" id="important-a-description-is-not-a-description">
<h4>Important: A Description Is Not a Description!</h4>

<p>Just to make matters a little more confusing, Inform’s Documentation
uses the word “description” in two entirely different ways. What we’re
talking about in this chapter is the description <em>property</em> of an
object in the world of the story. This type of description is the text
that will be printed out in the game when the object is examined (or
when the room is examined using the LOOK command). However, <a href="../WI_6.html">Chapter 6 of
<em>Writing with Inform</em>, “Descriptions”</a>, uses the word in another
sense &ndash; to refer to certain phrases you’ll use in your code &ndash; for
instance, the text with which you specify the type of object you want to
create. The phrase “openable container” is a description you would use
in your code to specify that an object called cardboard box is something
that the player will be able to open, close, and put things in. But this
type of description is <em>not</em> what the player will see on
examining the cardboard box.</p>
</div>



<h3 id="scenery">Scenery</h3>

<p>Inform allows us to create many <strong>kinds</strong><span
id="Ref_kind" class="anchor"></span> of objects. The standard library
includes containers, mechanical devices, doors, people, and so on. (See
<a href="../WI_4.html">WI Chapter 4: Kinds</a> to learn more
about kinds.) The word “kind” is a technical term in Inform: It’s used
to define new types of objects when the game will include several of
them, and we want them to behave in similar ways. For instance, if a
puzzle involves spelling words with alphabet blocks, we might do
this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`An alphabet block is a kind of thing.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">An alphabet block is a kind of thing.</div>
</div>
<p>After writing this, we could write rules that would apply to all
alphabet blocks, and Inform would know what we were talking about. A
trap that beginning Inform authors sometimes fall into is to use the
word “kind” in the casual way that an English speaker would use it. For
example:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A leopard is a kind of animal.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A leopard is a kind of animal.</div>
</div>
<p>Inform knows what an animal is, so this sentence will compile. But
oddly enough, the sentence doesn’t create an object called a leopard. It
creates a <em>kind</em> of object, on the assumption that you will later
be writing about a small leopard, a large leopard, a spotless leopard,
and a leaping leopard (or whatever), and that you plan to write some
code that will be used by all of the objects of the leopard kind. If you
want to create only one actual leopard, don’t use the word “kind”:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A leopard is an animal.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A leopard is an animal.</div>
</div>
<p>The first type of object we’re going to meet in this book is scenery.
To make matters a little more confusing, however, the word “scenery” in
Inform does not refer to a <em>kind</em> of object at all; it’s a
property that can be applied to almost any object. A thing (the basic
kind) can be scenery; a container or supporter can be scenery; a door
can be scenery; a device can be scenery; and so on. Things, containers,
supporters, doors, and devices are all different kinds.</p>

<p>If we don’t say anything more specific when creating scenery, Inform
assumes that the object we’re creating is just an ordinary thing, not a
device, door, or container. It also assumes that scenery is fixed in
place: that it’s not something the player can pick up and carry
around.</p>

<p>When your game is constructing a room description to print out, it
will mention any ordinary objects that are lying around in the room, but
it won’t mention scenery objects (unless the object is a supporter that
has something else sitting on it; see <a
href="#containers-supporters">Containers &amp; Supporters</a> for more on supporters). Inform
assumes that you mentioned the scenery objects in your own room
description when you wrote it, so be sure to do so.</p>

<p>We can add scenery to our forest path like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you.”\n\nThe tall old trees are scenery in the Forest Path. The description is “Ancient oaks stretch out their heavy branches overhead, blocking the sun.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you.”</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The tall old trees are scenery in the Forest Path. The description is “Ancient oaks stretch out their heavy branches overhead, blocking the sun.”</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player who types X TREES will be able to read a description
that adds detail to the scene. Notice that here I’ve started the
sentence by saying:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is [… and so on …]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is [… and so on …]</div>
</div>

<p>The phrase “The description is” is optional with scenery and rooms,
but it’s <em>required</em> with objects that can be picked up and moved
around (as described in Chapter 3). If you don’t use “The description
is” with scenery, you should be sure to always put the description in
the very next sentence after you’ve created the scenery object. The code
below works exactly like what was shown above &ndash; but only with scenery,
not with ordinary things.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The tall old trees are scenery in the Forest Path. “Ancient oaks stretch out their heavy branches overhead, blocking the sun.”`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The tall old trees are scenery in the Forest Path. “Ancient oaks stretch out their heavy branches overhead, blocking the sun.”</div></div>

<h4 id="the-names-of-things">The Names of Things</h4>

<p>If you try out this code, you’ll soon discover two problems. First,
you can X TREES, X TALL TREES, or X OLD TREES, because the scenery
object was created with the name “tall old trees,” but you can’t X OAKS
or X ANCIENT OAKS. The parser will reply, “You can’t see any such
thing,” which is fairly silly. It happens &ndash; and this is important &ndash;
because Inform never looks inside of double-quoted text to see what
words you used there. Second, if you should try something like TAKE
TREES, the parser will complain, “That’s hardly portable.” The word
“trees” is plural, so the correct output would be “Those are hardly
portable.” But the parser doesn’t know that the trees object is plural.
We have to help it out a little.</p>

<p>To solve the first problem, we’ll add an Understand rule to the
trees. You’ll soon find that most of the objects you create in your
games will need Understand rules of this type. Their main purpose is to
add vocabulary &ndash; extra words that the player can use to refer to the
objects. (The concept of rules is vital to Inform. You’ll write many
rules in your own code, and you’ll see them used throughout this
<em>Handbook</em>. For more details, consult <a href="../WI_19.html">Chapter 19 of <em>Writing
with Inform</em></a>.)</p>

<p>To solve the second problem, we need to make sure the parser
understands that the tall old trees object is
<strong>plural-named.</strong> There are two ways to do this. We can do
it explicitly, by adding the sentence, “The tall old trees are
plural-named” to our source. Or we can do it implicitly, by changing the
sentence where we create the trees so that it refers to “Some tall old
trees”. The second method is easier. Inform knows that when things are
created using the word “some”, they’re plural-named. When we put it all
together, the trees will look like this in our source code:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\n\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Some tall old trees are scenery in the Forest Path. “Ancient oaks
stretch out their heavy branches overhead, blocking the sun.” Understand
“ancient”, “oaks”, “heavy”, “branches”, “branch”, and “tree” as the tall
old trees.</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that when we add vocabulary words to the trees object, we have
to put the commas that separate items in the list of words
<em>outside</em> the quotation marks.</p>

<p>This usage of “some” to create a plural-named object is convenient,
but there’s a potential problem to be aware of. In English, some nouns
are “collective.” Examples would include things like sand and water. If
we write “Some sand is scenery in the Beach,” Inform will be confused
into thinking the sand is plural-named. If it needs to construct a
sentence that includes the sand object, it will say “The sand are&hellip;”.
To avoid this, we need to create the sand using “the”, not “some” &ndash; and
then we need to tell Inform to refer to the sand as “some sand” when it
needs to construct a sentence, not as “a sand”. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The sand is scenery in the Beach. The indefinite article of the sand is &quot;some&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The sand is scenery in the Beach. The indefinite article of the sand is "some".</div>
</div>

<p>The term “indefinite article” refers, in English, to the words “a”
and “an”. See <a href="../WI_3.html#section_18">WI 3.18: Articles and proper names</a> for more on this technique.</p>

<p>Once we’ve created the tall old trees as a scenery object, we can
refer to the object in our source code either as “tall old trees” or
just as “trees”. The compiler will understand either form. However, You
may want to get in the habit of always using the full names of objects
when writing your game. If you use the short forms of names, Inform will
usually understand what you meant, but it’s possible to end up with code
that includes hard-to-find bugs.</p>

<p>The reason is this: You may have several objects in your game whose
name ends with the noun “trees” &ndash; the tall old trees in the forest, the
pear trees in the orchard, and the shoe trees in the closet. If you just
say “trees” in your source code, the compiler will try to figure out
which object you meant, and it will usually get it right. But once in a
while it will get confused. The result could be disastrous: The player
might try to pick up the shoe trees and end up carrying around the whole
forest or the orchard by mistake.</p>

<p>For the same reason, it’s a good idea to get in the habit of naming
every object with at least one adjective in addition to the noun. Odd
things can happen if you have one object called the beach ball and
another object that’s simply called the ball.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering &ndash; no, it’s not possible to refer to the tall
old trees in your own source code as “the ancient oaks”. Words in
Understand rules are strictly for the player’s convenience, not for the
author’s use.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, players don’t know what’s important. So
they’ll try out anything they can think of. With the tall old trees, we
can expect the player to try CLIMB TREES (or more likely, CLIMB TREE, as
you can’t very well climb several trees at once). By default, this will
  be the output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>climb tree</div>
<p>I don’t think much is to be achieved by that.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with this output, except that it’s boring. We
can make it more interesting using an Instead rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of climbing the tall old trees:\n\tsay “Vicious flocks of sparrows and wrens dart down at you and peck at you with their sharp little beaks, driving you back.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of climbing the tall old trees:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say “Vicious flocks of sparrows and wrens dart down at you and peck at you with their sharp little beaks, driving you back.”</div>
</div>

<p>The actual result in the game is the same as before: Nothing has
happened. The player is still standing in the room called Forest Path.
(And if the player tries X SPARROWS, there won’t be any sparrows in the
room. We haven’t yet created any!) But the game is a little more
interesting and fun than before. As you write messages like this, you
might even start to wonder, what are those sparrows and wrens trying so
hard to protect? This might suggest a puzzle that you can add to the
game, such as scattering birdseed to distract the homicidal songbirds.
After scattering the birdseed, the player might be allowed to climb a
tree after all. But that type of complication will have to wait for a
later chapter.</p>

<h4 id="how-much-scenery-is-enough">How Much Scenery Is Enough?</h4>

<p>As noted in Chapter 1, in the section “The Detail Trap,” it’s easy to
get sidetracked by trying to cram too much scenery into a room. If your
story is set in a modern house, the house will probably have a bathroom.
You may be tempted to add a toilet, toilet paper, a sink with faucets, a
bar of soap, towels and washcloths on a towel rack, a mirror that opens
to reveal a medicine cabinet stocked with pill containers, a bathtub
with a showerhead and a drain. This level of detail is probably not
necessary, and may even be a bad thing. It’s a lot of extra work &ndash; and
if you include these objects, the player will expect that manipulating
them will have something to do with the story. If they’re just scenery,
the player will be disappointed not to be able to look at herself in the
mirror, turn the faucets on and off, and so forth.</p>

<p>All the same, it’s jarring, if the game includes a bathroom, to see
this kind of output:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Bathroom</p>

<p>A typical bathroom. The door is to the west.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x tub</div>

<p>You can't see any such thing.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x sink</div>

<p>You can't see any such thing.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x toilet</div>

<p>You can't see any such thing.</p>
</div>

<p>These responses destroy the illusion that the player is in a real
room. A better approach is to create a single scenery object that stands
in for all of the things in the room that aren’t important:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Some fixtures are scenery in the Bathroom. Understand &quot;sink&quot;, &quot;toilet&quot;, &quot;faucet&quot;, &quot;mirror&quot;, &quot;cabinet&quot;, &quot;tub&quot;, &quot;basin&quot;, &quot;shower&quot;, &quot;towel&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, and &quot;mat&quot; as the fixtures. The description is &quot;The bathroom fixtures are not very interesting.&quot;\n\nInstead of doing anything other than examining with the fixtures:\n\tsay &quot;You have more important things to do right now than fiddle with the bathroom fixtures.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Some fixtures are scenery in the Bathroom. Understand "sink", "toilet", "faucet", "mirror", "cabinet", "tub", "basin", "shower", "towel", "bath", and "mat" as the fixtures. The description is "The bathroom fixtures are not very interesting."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of doing anything other than examining with the fixtures:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You have more important things to do right now than fiddle with the bathroom fixtures."</div>
</div>
<p>This preserves at least a thin illusion that the bathroom is a real
place, while directing the player’s attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, if an object is mentioned in the room
description, it should probably be implemented as a separate scenery
object. A “stand-in scenery object” like the one shown above would be a
better choice for things that the player might naturally expect to be in
this sort of room, but that aren’t important to the game.</p>

<h3 id="distant-scenery">Distant Scenery</h3>

<p>It often happens, as you write a room description of an outdoor
“room,” that you’ll want to mention things that are far away &ndash; visible,
but not something that can be interacted with. Inform has no built-in
way to handle this situation, but we can easily create one.</p>

<p>We’ll start by showing the problem, and then show how to fix it. Here
is our first attempt at source code:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest Path is a room. &quot;Tall old trees surround you. The path\ncontinues north and south. In the distance to the west, off among the\ntrees, you can see a crumbling stone wall.&quot;\n\nThe crumbling stone wall is scenery in the Forest Path. &quot;The wall is\nancient and moss-covered.&quot; Understand &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;moss-covered&quot; as\nthe stone wall.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest Path is a room. "Tall old trees surround you. The path</div>
<div class="codeline">continues north and south. In the distance to the west, off among the</div>
<div class="codeline">trees, you can see a crumbling stone wall."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The crumbling stone wall is scenery in the Forest Path. "The wall is</div>
<div class="codeline">ancient and moss-covered." Understand "ancient" and "moss-covered" as</div>
<div class="codeline">the stone wall.</div>
</div>
<p>This code is fine, up to a point. The player can now examine the
wall. But while the room description indicates that the wall is off in
the distance, Inform doesn’t know that. The result, when the player
tries doing things with the wall, is less than great:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x wall</div>

<p>The wall is ancient and moss-covered.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>touch wall</div>

<p>You feel nothing unexpected.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take wall</div>

<p>That's hardly portable.</p>
</div>

<p>Obviously, the player character wouldn’t be able to touch the wall,
because it has been described (in the room description) as far away. To
solve this problem, we’re going to create a new
<strong>property</strong>. Objects in Inform can have many properties.
(You can view the properties of any object in the Game panel by typing
SHOWME and the name of the object.) The printed name and description are
properties, for instance. And creating new properties is easy. Let’s
create an either/or property called distant/near. Every object in the
model world will be either distant or near, but all of them will be near
unless we say otherwise:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing can be distant or near. A thing is usually near.\n\nInstead of doing anything other than examining to a distant thing:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] [are] too far away.&quot;\n\nThe crumbling stone wall is scenery in the Forest Path. &quot;The wall is ancient and moss-covered.&quot; Understand &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;moss-covered&quot; as the stone wall. The stone wall is distant.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A thing can be distant or near. A thing is usually near.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of doing anything other than examining to a distant thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] [are] too far away."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The crumbling stone wall is scenery in the Forest Path. "The wall is ancient and moss-covered." Understand "ancient" and "moss-covered" as the stone wall. The stone wall is distant.</div>
</div>
<p>After creating distant as a property, we can make the stone wall (or
anything else) distant, just by saying that it is. Now the output will
be a lot more sensible:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>touch wall</div>

<p>The crumbling stone wall is too far away.</p>
</div>

<p>The code above assumes that the distant thing will always be the
first object the player refers to in an input. That is, it will be the
<em>direct object</em> of the verb. In Inform source code, the direct
object is referred to as the <strong>noun</strong>. If there’s another
noun later in the command (usually it would be in a prepositional
phrase), you would refer to it in your source as the <strong>second
noun</strong>.</p>

<p>To be safe, we might also want to trap commands like PUT VASE ON
STONE WALL. In this command, the stone wall is the second noun. To
  handle this, you can write:</p>
                                   
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of doing anything when the second noun is a distant thing:\n\tsay &quot;[The second noun] [are] too far away.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of doing anything when the second noun is a distant thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The second noun] [are] too far away."</div>
</div>
<p>This code won’t work well if the command involves, for instance,
talking to an NPC about a distant thing. ASK GUARD ABOUT STONE WALL
might produce the output, “The stone wall is too far away.” In fact,
this will only happen if we’ve written our game so as to allow the ASK
ABOUT action to refer to actual things, not just to topics. The way to
do this is explained in Chapter 5, in the section <a href="#topics-of-conversation">Topics of
Conversation</a>. But
wanting to exclude certain actions from an “Instead of doing anything”
rule might come up in other situations too, so we’ll dig into it here.
After creating an action called quizzing about, as explained in that
section of Chapter 5, we could allow distant things to be quizzed about
like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of doing anything other than quizzing someone about something when the second noun is a distant thing:\n\tsay &quot;[The second noun] [are] too far away.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of doing anything other than quizzing someone about something when the second noun is a distant thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The second noun] [are] too far away."</div>
</div>
<p>If you’re reading closely, you may wonder why the code above uses
“[are]”, and why this produces the word “is” when you test the game.
This is one of the newer features of Inform. We’ll have more to say
about this type of text substitution in Chapter 9. The point of doing it
this way is that Inform is smart enough to tell whether the object under
discussion is singular or plural. It will select “is” or “are” as
needed. If we just wrote, “[The second noun] is too far away”, distant
things that were plural-named, such as geese winging across the sky,
wouldn’t work quite right. We’d see this:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>touch geese</div>

<p>The geese is too far away.</p>
</div>

<p>With the geese, we might prefer to create a distant thing called the
flock of geese, and not make it plural-named (since “flock” is
singular). A herd of cows could be handled the same way. But if you get
in the habit of using this type of text substitution when writing
default messages that may have to apply to a number of different
objects, your game will read much more smoothly.</p>

<p>For a more complex way of creating an outdoor environment that
includes items in other locations, see “Indoors &amp; Outdoors” in
Appendix B of this book.</p>

<p>At this writing, <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Jon%20Ingold/Far%20Away-v5.i7x">Jon Ingold’s Far Away extension</a>, which is designed
specifically to deal with things that are too far away to be touched,
has not been upgraded for 6L38 compatibility. To learn how to update it
(and other extensions), turn to Appendix B.</p>

<div class="addendum">Far Away is available for 9.3/6M62 and 10.1.</div>

<p>Once you’ve edited Far Away, it will do what we’ve been discussing in
this section. Just put</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include far Away by Jon Ingold.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Include far Away by Jon Ingold.</div>
</div>
<p>near the top of your source code and then write a sentence saying
that the crumbling stone wall is distant. With the extension in place,
you won’t need to write your own Instead rules to produce “too far away”
messages. You may want to do so for particular literary reasons. For
example:</p>
<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>touch moon</div>

<p>The moon is much, much too far away!</p>
</div>

<p>But you won’t need to do that unless you want to.</p>

<h3 id="adding-more-rooms-to-the-map">Adding More Rooms to the Map</h3>

<p>It’s
possible to write a complete short game that takes place in a single
room. But most games will need a number of rooms. The player travels
from one room to another using standard compass directions &ndash; NORTH (or
  simply N), SOUTHWEST (SW), and so on.</p>

<p>Other methods of travel have been tried by various authors, and you
may want to experiment with them at some point. In <a href="https://aareed.itch.io/blue-lacuna">Blue Lacuna by Aaron Reed</a>, you can travel from place to place by typing the name of
something that lies in the direction that you want to go. In a game
designed like this, CASTLE will take you closer to the castle (or cause
you to enter it, if you’re already close), and so on. Aaron has released
this system as <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/9.3/Aaron%20Reed/Keyword%20Interface.i7x">Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed</a>. You’ll find
that it’s more complex than the average extension, so you should expect
to do some study and some testing in order to get it to work the way
you’d like it to in your game.</p>

<p>If your story is set aboard a ship, you may want to replace N, S, E,
and W with FORWARD, AFT, PORT, and STARBOARD. (<a href="../examples/fore.html">Example
    42: Fore</a> shows how to do this. <a href="../WI_3.html#section_26">WI 3.26: Directions</a> offers some other
suggestions.) But for your first game, I’d suggest sticking with compass
directions. All players who are not complete newcomers to IF will know
how to use them.</p>

<p>Inform makes it very easy to set up a map containing rooms that are
  connected by compass directions. <a href="../WI_3.html#section_2">WI 3.2: Rooms and the map</a>  and <a href="../WI_3.html#section_2">WI 3.3: One-way
connections</a> explain how to do it, but we’ll take a quick look here,
and suggest ways to work through problems that may come up.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created your first room, you can create more rooms simply
by describing the map to Inform, like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you. The path\ncontinues north and south from here.”\n\nCanyon View is north of Forest Path. “The path from the south ends\nhere at the top of a cliff, from which you have a spectacular view of a\ncanyon.”\n\nHaunted Grove is south of Forest Path. “The trees press close around\nyou, moaning faintly and waving their branches in an unsettling way. A\npath leads north.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest Path is a room. “Tall old trees surround you. The path</div>
<div class="codeline">continues north and south from here.”</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Canyon View is north of Forest Path. “The path from the south ends</div>
<div class="codeline">here at the top of a cliff, from which you have a spectacular view of a</div>
<div class="codeline">canyon.”</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Haunted Grove is south of Forest Path. “The trees press close around</div>
<div class="codeline">you, moaning faintly and waving their branches in an unsettling way. A</div>
<div class="codeline">path leads north.”</div>
</div>

<p>This text will create a map with three rooms &ndash; from north to south,
Canyon View, Forest Path, and Haunted Grove. Inform is smart enough to
understand that if you say “Canyon View is north of Forest Path,” Canyon
View must also be a room, because rooms and doors are the only things
that can be related to other rooms using a compass direction. We haven’t
told Inform that Canyon View is a door, so it must be a room.</p>

<p>Inform understands that the connections you have described run both
ways. That is, because you’ve said Haunted Grove is south of Forest
Path, Forest Path will automatically be mapped north of Haunted Grove.
The player who goes south from Forest Path will be in Haunted Grove, and
by going north from Haunted Grove the player will return to Forest
Path.</p>

<p>The directions you can travel to leave a room are often called the
room’s exits. But “exits” is not a term that Inform understands, unless
you write some code or include an extension that defines the word.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create room connections that are one-way, or that bend.
We’ll show how to do that later in this chapter. A few map connections
of this sort may be useful to make your world seem more real, but they
tend to annoy players. Players expect that if they traveled from room A
to room B using the command E, they should be able to get back to their
  previous location by typing W.</p>

<p>The room descriptions for Forest Path, Canyon View, and Haunted Grove
all tell the player which directions they can travel in when leaving the
room. This is a nice way to help the player, though it can make the
writing seem a little clumsy. As mentioned earlier, you can download and
install an Inform extension (<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Exit%20Lister-v11.i7x">Exit Lister by Eric Eve</a>) that will place
the available compass directions in the status line at the top of the
game window.</p>

<p><a href="../WI_3.html#section_2">WI 3.2: Rooms and
the map</a> explains how to deal with a small but sometimes annoying
problem in naming rooms and defining map connections: What if you have a
room called Hut, and now you want to name a room South Of The Hut? This
won’t work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`South Of The Hut is south of the Hut. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">South Of The Hut is south of the Hut. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Nor will this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`South Of The Hut is a room. South Of The Hut is south of the Hut.\n[Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">South Of The Hut is a room. South Of The Hut is south of the Hut.</div>
<div class="codeline">[Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Either of these would work if Inform noticed the way we’re using
capital letters, but it doesn’t. The solution is to use the word
“called”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`South of the Hut is a room called South Of The Hut.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">South of the Hut is a room called South Of The Hut.</div>
</div>

<p>This sentence may look as if it was written by Gertrude Stein. (An
avant-garde author of the early 20th century, Stein is most famous for
the line, “Rose is a rose is a rose.”)</p>

<p>As you can see, Inform’s “natural language” syntax can occasionally
be misleading or difficult for humans to read. The sentence makes sense
if you read it the right way: South (a direction) of the Hut (a room
we’ve already told Inform about) is a room (another room &ndash; a new one,
this time) called South Of The Hut. This works perfectly, assuming
Inform already knows there’s a room called the Hut.</p>

<p>The same problem can arise if we want to call a room something like
Inside the Stone House. Inform understands “inside” and “outside” (or
“in” and “out”) as directions for travel. So we can’t do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Inside the Stone House is inside from Haunted Grove. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Inside the Stone House is inside from Haunted Grove. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Haunted Grove is south of Forest Path. &quot;The trees press close around you, moaning faintly and waving their branches in an unsettling way. A path leads north, and a house built of stone stands here.&quot;\n\nInside from Haunted Grove is a room called Inside the Stone House. The description of Inside the Stone House is &quot;A small, dimly lit room. A doorway to the north leads deeper into the house.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Haunted Grove is south of Forest Path. "The trees press close around you, moaning faintly and waving their branches in an unsettling way. A path leads north, and a house built of stone stands here."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Inside from Haunted Grove is a room called Inside the Stone House. The description of Inside the Stone House is "A small, dimly lit room. A doorway to the north leads deeper into the house."</div>
</div>

<p>Notice the phrase “The description of Inside the Stone House is”.
Telling Inform that a description is a description is not usually needed
when we define a room, but it is needed here. If we simply start a new
sentence with “A small, dimly lit room,” Inform will think we’re giving
a description of Haunted Grove. But we’ve already given Haunted Grove a
description, so we won’t be allowed to give it another one. The rule is,
Inform looks at the <em>first</em> room in the previous sentence
(Haunted Grove) and thinks it’s what we’re talking about if we just
start a new sentence with a quotation mark. Since we want to write a
description of Inside the Stone House, we have to help Inform understand
what we have in mind.</p>

<p>If you compile the simple game we’ve been working on so far, which
now has four rooms (Forest Path, Canyon View, Haunted Grove, and Inside
the Stone House), you’ll find that in Haunted Grove, the travel command
IN takes you into the stone house, and OUT gets you back out into
Haunted Grove.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="where-did-it-go">
<h4>Where Did It Go?</h4>

<p>The numbering of the Examples in Inform’s Documentation may change in
future versions. Likewise the numbering of the pages. However, the names
of both Examples and pages should remain the same. If you can’t find a
page cross-referenced in this <em>Handbook,</em> consider the
possibility that the numbering has changed.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidebar" id="capital-offense">
<h4>Capital Offense</h4>

<p>In most situations, Inform is not fussy about whether you capitalize
words in your source text. But you can’t use a capital when mentioning
map directions in your source (unless the direction is the first word in
a sentence). Below are three code examples. The first two work, and
produce exactly the same map; the third is a bug, and won’t compile.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-outdoors">The Great Outdoors</h3>

<p>Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Distant Scenery,” we looked
at how to make distant scenery items that could be examined but not
interacted with in any other way. But it’s also possible that when
you’re creating an outdoors area, you’ll want the player to be able to
use commands like ‘look north’ to be able to inspect what’s in the
distance. And if there are any objects in the game that are large enough
to be seen from a distance, it would be natural to want the output of a
‘look north’ command to mention them.</p>

<p>In addition, once a large object has been brought to the player’s
attention in this way, you might want the player to be able to examine
it, even if the result is something like, “Professor Plum is too far
away for you to make out any detail.” This requirement is a bit tricky
to code, because as far as Inform is concerned, things that are in other
rooms are not in scope, which means the player won’t be able to refer to
them at all. Or rather, the player is free to refer to them, but the
parser will pretend they don’t exist.</p>

<p>If you want to write a realistic outdoor setting, spend some time
studying <a href="../RB_3.html#section_4">RB 3.4: Continuous Spaces and the Outdoors</a>. The examples there illustrate some powerful
techniques. Here we’ll take a quick look at a couple of them. First, a
slight revision of the “Distant Scenery” example. We’re going to create
a couple of distant scenery objects. We’ll give them names that start
with “view-of-” so that Inform won’t confuse them with the real objects
in other locations.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing can be distant or near.

</div>

<p>Next, we’ll allow the player to look in a direction:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Direction-looking is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light. Understand &quot;look [direction]&quot; as direction-looking. \n\nCarry out direction-looking:\n\tsay &quot;You see nothing unusual in that direction.&quot; \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Direction-looking is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out direction-looking:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You see nothing unusual in that direction." </div>
</div>

<p>Next, we’ll create a response when the player looks in a direction
where we’ve placed some interesting scenery:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of direction-looking west in the Forest Path:\n\tsay &quot;There&apos;s a low stone wall off in the distance to the west.&quot;\nInstead of direction-looking east in By the Wall:\n\tsay &quot;To the east, a path meanders from north to south among the trees.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of direction-looking west in the Forest Path:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There's a low stone wall off in the distance to the west."</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of direction-looking east in By the Wall:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "To the east, a path meanders from north to south among the trees."</div>
</div>

<p>But what if the player has dropped something large in the other
location? Ideally, we’d like it to be mentioned when the player looks in
that direction. This requires a few more steps. Near the top of the code
for the game, we do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A room has some text called the containing-name. The containing-name of a room is usually &quot;&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A room has some text called the containing-name. The containing-name of a room is usually "".</div>
</div>

<p>To test the functionality we’re going to add, we’ll need an object
large enough to be visible from a distance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing can be huge. A thing is usually not huge.\n\nThe beach ball is in Forest Path. The beach ball is huge. The description is &quot;Red and white.&quot; Understand &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; as the beach ball.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A thing can be huge. A thing is usually not huge.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The beach ball is in Forest Path. The beach ball is huge. The description is "Red and white." Understand "red" and "white" as the beach ball.</div>
</div>

<p>Next, we’ll give our outdoor rooms containing-names, and add a
function that will use this property:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The containing-name of the Forest Path is &quot;Lying on the path&quot;.\nThe containing-name of By the Wall is &quot;Not far from the wall&quot;.\n\nTo scrutinize (R - a room):\n\tlet L be a list of things;\n\trepeat with item running through things in R:\n\t\tif item is huge:\n\t\t\tadd item to L;\n\tif the number of entries in L &gt; 0:\n\t\tsay &quot; [The containing-name of R] you can see &quot;;\n\t\tsay &quot;[L with indefinite articles].&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;[line break]&quot;. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The containing-name of the Forest Path is "Lying on the path".</div>
<div class="codeline">The containing-name of By the Wall is "Not far from the wall".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To scrutinize (R - a room):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be a list of things;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through things in R:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if item is huge:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;add item to L;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of entries in L &gt; 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say " [The containing-name of R] you can see ";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[L with indefinite articles].";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[line break]". </div>
</div>

<p>The final step is to revise the code for direction-looking so as to
take advantage of the scrutinizing function:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of direction-looking west in the Forest Path:\n\tsay &quot;There&apos;s a low stone wall off in the distance to the west.[run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\tscrutinize By the Wall.\nInstead of direction-looking east in By the Wall:\n\tsay &quot;To the east, a path meanders from north to south among the trees.[run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\tscrutinize the Forest Path.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of direction-looking west in the Forest Path:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There's a low stone wall off in the distance to the west.[run paragraph on]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;scrutinize By the Wall.</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of direction-looking east in By the Wall:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "To the east, a path meanders from north to south among the trees.[run paragraph on]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;scrutinize the Forest Path.</div>
</div>

<p>With these additions, when we go west to By the Wall and LOOK EAST,
we’ll get this output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>look east</div>

<p>To the east, a path meanders from north to south among the trees.
Lying on the path you can see a beach ball.</p>
</div>


<p>One problem remains. The beach ball is being mentioned (because it’s
huge), but the command X BALL will produce the output “You can’t see any
such thing.” True, there’s not much to see, because the beach ball is
far away, but it would be nice if the parser didn’t produce such a
confusing output. To fix it, we would need to play with the scoping
rules. Fortunately, Example 365 in the Documentation, “Stately Gardens,”
which is part of the “Continuous Spaces and the Outdoors” page in the
<em>Recipe Book</em>, shows exactly how to do this, so we don’t need to
go into it here. The solution begins with some code that looks something
like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Great Outdoors is a region. The Forest Path and By the Wall are in the Great Outdoors.\n\nAfter deciding the scope of the player when the player is in the Great Outdoors:\n\trepeat with the way running through directions:\n\t\tlet next-room be the room the way from the location;\n\t\tif the next-room is a room:\n\t\t\tplace the next-room in scope.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Great Outdoors is a region. The Forest Path and By the Wall are in the Great Outdoors.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After deciding the scope of the player when the player is in the Great Outdoors:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with the way running through directions:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let next-room be the room the way from the location;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the next-room is a room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;place the next-room in scope.</div>
</div>

<p>More detail would be needed to produce a convincing illusion of the
great outdoors, but this should give you an idea of what’s required:
Objects in adjacent rooms have now been added to scope, which means the
parser will recognize them when the player refers to them. They can now
be examined (but nothing else) from adjacent rooms in the region. For a
more complete implementation, with which the player can throw things in
a direction and have them sail away out of sight, see “Indoors &amp;
Outdoors” in Appendix B.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="the-the">
<h4>The “The”</h4>

<p>If you know a little about Inform programming, you might think that
because the view-of-wall object created in the example above is
privately-named and has a printed name, the code could just as easily
read “View-of-wall is privately-named scenery&hellip;”, rather than, “The
view-of-wall is privately-named scenery&hellip;”. Since the name
“view-of-wall” will never be used, why should the “The” make the
slightest difference?</p>

<p>It does, though. If you omit the “The” when writing a paragraph that
creates an object, Inform will assume that the object is proper-named.
(An example of how this mechanism is designed to work would be if you
create an object by saying, “Bob is a man in the Gazebo.” Inform
correctly infers that the object called Bob is proper-named, so it will
never construct an output sentence that refers to “the Bob.”) The
compiler will make this assumption even if the object is
privately-named. As a result, substitution strings such as “[The noun]”
in your text output code won’t work properly if you omit the “The”.
Normally, this substitution will produce “The wall” in the output, or
“Bob”, as needed. The “The” (either capitalized or not) is suppressed
with proper-named objects. So if you forget the “The”, you’ll see ugly
outputs like “wall is too far away.”</p>
</div>

<h3 id="enterable-scenery">Enterable Scenery</h3>

<p>When the “room” is an outdoor location and a building is nearby,
making the exterior of the building scenery is a good idea. This is not
hard to do, but it can lead to two small problems that we need to look
at.</p>

<p>First, we can’t give the building’s scenery exterior the same name as
the room that is its interior. This might easily happen with a one-room
building such as a barn or hut. This won’t work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Farmyard is a room. &quot;A muddy farmyard. A little red barn stands to the north.&quot;\n\nThe little red barn is scenery in the Farmyard. The description is &quot;The barn is freshly painted a cheerful bright red.&quot;\n\nLittle Red Barn is north of the Farmyard. &quot;In the barn you can see some stalls and some hay.&quot; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Farmyard is a room. "A muddy farmyard. A little red barn stands to the north."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The little red barn is scenery in the Farmyard. The description is "The barn is freshly painted a cheerful bright red."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Little Red Barn is north of the Farmyard. "In the barn you can see some stalls and some hay." [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>The compiler will object, quite rightly, that we’ve tried to name two
things &ndash; a scenery object and then a room &ndash; using the same name. Here’s
how to solve the problem:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The barn-exterior is scenery in the Farmyard. The description is &quot;The barn is freshly painted a cheerful bright red.&quot; Understand &quot;little&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;barn&quot; as the barn-exterior. The printed name of the barn-exterior is &quot;little red barn&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The barn-exterior is scenery in the Farmyard. The description is "The barn is freshly painted a cheerful bright red." Understand "little", "red", and "barn" as the barn-exterior. The printed name of the barn-exterior is "little red barn".</div>
</div>

<p>Now the scenery object has its own name for code purposes,
barn-exterior. But we’ve given it “little”, “red”, and “barn” as
vocabulary, and we’ve also told Inform that if the game ever needs to
print out its name for reader/players, it should call it “little red
barn.”</p>

<p>The second problem we need to deal with is that the player may try
ENTER BARN as a command. Unless we say otherwise, Inform will report to
the player that scenery objects can’t be entered. When the scenery
object is a building exterior, this is both rude and misleading. But
it’s easy to fix. While we’re at it, we’ll allow the player to use IN as
a command, when in the Farmyard, in order to enter the little red
barn:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of entering the barn-exterior:\n\ttry going north.\nInstead of going inside in the Farmyard:\n\ttry going north.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of entering the barn-exterior:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try going north.</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going inside in the Farmyard:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try going north.</div>
</div>

<p>If
the enterable thing is small (a refrigerator carton or phone booth, for
instance) we might want to make it an enterable container rather than a
separate room. (See the section on “Enterable Containers &amp;
Supporters” in Chapter 3.) With a larger object, making it a separate
room will work better.</p>

<h3 id="doors">Doors</h3>

<p>In the real world, most indoor rooms are separated by doors. In
Inform, a door is a special type of object because it’s in two rooms at
once and connects the two. In this section but we’ll look at a couple of
ways to improve on the default doors.</p>

<p>To create a door, create the rooms on both sides of the door first,
but <em>don’t</em> connect the rooms by mentioning directions. If you
mention the directional connection between the rooms, Inform won’t let
you create a door between them. After creating the rooms, create the
door, and tell Inform about its directions with respect to the two
rooms:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Entry Hall is a room.\nThe Billiard Room is a room.\nThe oak door is a door. The oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Entry Hall.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Entry Hall is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The Billiard Room is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The oak door is a door. The oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Entry Hall.</div>
</div>

<p>We can’t just name the oak door using the word “door”: We have to add
that extra sentence telling Inform that the door is a door. The
following will compile, but it’s an error:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Entry Hall is a room.\nThe Billiard Room is a room.\nThe oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Entry Hall. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Entry Hall is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The Billiard Room is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Entry Hall. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>If we write it this way, Inform will think “oak door” is the name of
a room. It will create a third room called oak door, which will lie
between the other two rooms. You might think that Inform should
understand that calling something a door makes it a door, but that could
conceivably cause unexpected problems. What if you were creating rooms
named after science fiction novels, and wanted a room called The Door
Into Summer? To avoid this type of confusion, the compiler needs to be
cautious so you’ll have to write the extra sentence.</p>

<p>If you include the code shown above (the first three lines, not the
second three) in your game, you’ll notice that the door itself will be
mentioned by the game’s output along with any other objects in the room.
In other words, a door is not scenery unless we make it scenery.</p>

<p>Inform’s doors start out closed unless the author says otherwise, but
will be automatically opened to allow the player to travel from place to
place:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>s</div>

<p>(first opening the oak door)</p>

<p class="bold">Billiard Room</p>

<p>You can see an oak door here.</p>
</div>
<p>If you find “(first opening the oak door)” distracting, one solution
is not to make the room connections doors at all. When you need to
mention a connection between rooms in your room description, just call
it a “doorway.” Most players won’t mind if you sacrifice a bit of
realism in order to make the game work more smoothly. There’s usually
not much need for doors unless they’re part of a puzzle, or unless
they’re so obviously part of the scene that omitting them would be
unrealistic.</p>

<p>You can use the door kind in Inform to make other room-connecting
objects, such as gates, ladders, and bridges. A ladder or bridge
probably wouldn’t be openable: You’d want it to be permanently open. The
reason to make it a door is so that it will be visible in both of the
rooms that it connects. For instance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The wooden bridge is a scenery door. The wooden bridge is south of the Meadow and north of the Forest Path. The wooden bridge is open and not openable. The description is &quot;It&apos;s a handsome old bridge. Curiously, there&apos;s no creek running beneath it.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The wooden bridge is a scenery door. The wooden bridge is south of the Meadow and north of the Forest Path. The wooden bridge is open and not openable. The description is "It's a handsome old bridge. Curiously, there's no creek running beneath it."</div>
</div>

<p>It’s handy that Inform understands the command CROSS BRIDGE. If you
consult the Index/Actions page in the IDE, you’ll discover that CROSS is
a synonym for ENTER, so you don’t need to code it yourself. But if you
create a ladder using the door kind, you’ll need to write an Instead
rule to handle CLIMB LADDER:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of climbing the rickety ladder:\n\ttry entering the rickety ladder.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of climbing the rickety ladder:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try entering the rickety ladder.</div>
</div>

<p>Inform doors are unusual in a couple of ways. First, a door can’t be
moved. If you write a rule like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After throwing the brass lever:\n\tnow the weird door is in the Cellar.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After throwing the brass lever:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the weird door is in the Cellar.</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;the compiler will compile it, but you’ll get a run-time error when
you play the game. The error message will explain that doors can’t be
moved.</p>

<p>Second, unlike most other objects in your Inform code, a door object
is in two rooms at once. This makes sense, but it can lead to a problem.
If you put an ornate silver door knocker on one side of the front door,
the knocker will be visible on the inside of the door, even when the
door is closed! A simple solution in this case is to use the extension
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Emily%20Short/Deluxe%20Doors-v4.i7x">Deluxe Doors by Emily Short</a>. This extension allows you to create
“half-doors,” each of which represents only one side of the door, and to
keep them in sync, so that when the player opens or closes one of the
half-doors, the other opens or closes as well.</p>

<h4 id="locked-doors">Locked Doors</h4>

<p>A locked door is a slightly
different matter. Personally, I feel that a locked door and hidden key
don’t make for a very entertaining puzzle. Hundreds of games have
included locked doors, and if there’s a doormat or a potted plant
anywhere nearby, players will instantly know to LOOK UNDER MAT and
SEARCH POT. There’s just not much fun in it anymore. I have played with
this cliché in a couple of ways. In one game I included both a locked
door that can never be opened because there isn’t a key, and a locked
door to which another character spontaneously gives the player a key
without even being asked for it. Doors that can only be unlocked from
one side (after you find a secret entrance to the room) are slightly
more interesting.</p>

<p>Here’s how to create a locked door in Inform, and how to make it
friendly for the player. If the player carries the correct key, the door
will be unlocked</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Entry Hall. The oak door is a door. The oak door is scenery. The oak door is lockable and locked.

The oak door is a door. The oak door is scenery. The oak door is lockable and locked. The brass key unlocks the oak door.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before going through the oak door:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the oak door is closed and the oak door is locked:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player carries the brass key:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "(first unlocking the oak door with the brass key, then opening the door)[paragraph break]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the oak door is unlocked;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the oak door is open.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries the brass key.</div>
</div>

<p>Several new elements are introduced above. First, I’ve written a
Before rule. Later in this chapter you’ll see examples of Instead and
After rules. To learn how these rules work, and how to employ them in
your code, see <a href="#action-processing">Action Processing</a>. Next, and more
to the point in this particular example, if something can be opened and
closed, we’re allowed to make it lockable. Lockable is a property of
certain kinds of objects: Doors and containers can be made lockable, but
nothing else. (Technically, this is not quite true. We can also make a
new kind of object &ndash; perhaps a detonator &ndash; and allow objects of that
kind to be lockable and locked.) Next, if something is lockable, at the
beginning of the game is can be either locked or unlocked. During the
game, the player who has the right key can unlock it &ndash; or your code can
do so in response to some action by the player. For instance, a door
with an old-fashioned bar might be locked and unlocked using the
commands BAR DOOR and UNBAR DOOR. Such a door might not have a key at
all.</p>

<p>You could write code so that a lockable door became not lockable, but
this would only become useful if there was a way within the game to
break the lock. Most often, a thing that is lockable will remain
lockable (and unlockable, obviously) throughout the game.</p>

<p>If you read <a href="../WI_3.html#section_13">WI 3.13: Locks and Keys</a>, you’ll learn three different ways to tell
Inform that a certain key can be used to unlock a lockable thing. The
sentence used above, “The brass key unlocks the oak door,” seems the
simplest.</p>

<p>In Inform, a lockable thing can have only one key. This is not
usually a big problem. If you need to, though, you can write an Instead
rule that will allow a second key to do the unlocking job. Here’s a
rather silly example. Let’s suppose we’ve already told Inform that the
tiny key unlocks the gold amulet, but we also want to be able to use the
banana as a key:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of unlocking the gold amulet with the banana:\n\tif the player does not carry the banana:\n\t\tsay &quot;You don&apos;t seem to be holding the banana.&quot;;\n\totherwise if the amulet is not locked:\n\t\tsay &quot;The gold amulet doesn&apos;t seem to be locked.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tnow the amulet is not locked;\n\t\tsay &quot;You unlock the gold amulet with the banana.&quot;\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of unlocking the gold amulet with the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You don't seem to be holding the banana.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if the amulet is not locked:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The gold amulet doesn't seem to be locked.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the amulet is not locked;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You unlock the gold amulet with the banana."</div>
</div>

<p>If you create the oak door as shown on the previous page, the oak
door will automatically be unlocked and then opened if the player
carries the key. The only downside of this code is that it assumes the
player <em>knows</em> the brass key unlocks the oak door. If you want to
force the player to discover that fact, you’ll have to work out a way to
track what the player knows. Keeping track of the player’s (or the
player character’s) knowledge is not difficult to manage, but the
details may differ from one game to the next. The extension <a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Eric%20Eve/Epistemology.i7x">Epistemology by Eric Eve</a> is designed to make it easy to track the player’s
knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="secret-doors">Secret Doors</h4>

<p>More interesting in a game than a locked door is a secret door &ndash;
something that doesn’t appear to be a door at all until its presence is
revealed. <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Andrew%20Owen/Secret%20Doors-v1.i7x">Secret Doors by Andrew Owen</a> is a simple extension that allows
you to create secret doors.</p>

<p>If you include this extension and then create a secret door, the door
will pretend not to exist until something happens in the game that
causes it to be revealed. For instance, if the door is disguised as oak
wall paneling, this would work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Secret Doors by Andrew Owen.\n\nThe Billiard Room is a room. &quot;Hand-rubbed oak paneling adds a warm glow above the broad green felt surface of the billiard table.&quot;\n\nThe Small Windowless Room is a room. &quot;It smells dusty in here, as if the secret door hasn&apos;t been opened in ages.&quot;\n\nThe oak door is north of the Billiard Room and south of the Small Windowless Room.

<h4 id="dangerous-doors">Dangerous Doors</h4>

<p>When I was teaching some younger students the basics of IF, one them
asked how to create a door that would slam shut behind the player. I
thought this might make an interesting puzzle, so I wrote it up. The

the player travels from one room to another:</p>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After going north from the Corridor:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the massive stone door is closed;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "As you step through the stone door, it swings shut with a terrible loud BOOM!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>You’ll notice that the massive stone door is initially open &ndash; but
also initially locked. Inform is happy to create a locked door that’s
open. As soon as the door is closed, its locked condition will keep it
from being opened again.</p>

<p>To learn more about the syntax in the room description, which
includes “[one of]” and “[stopping]”, see <a
href="#text-insertions">Text Insertions</a>.</p>

<p>If this door were used in a real game, there would of course be some
sort of hidden exit from the Dank Cell. Devising a hidden exit from a
cell that seems not to have any exits … well, let’s just say I’ve seen a
few authors try it, and some of their attempts were more convincing than
others. The idea that there might be a trapdoor under the straw on the
floor doesn’t quite work for me: Why would any sensible jailer ever
build a cell with a trapdoor in the floor? Giving the player a tool with
which to loosen the bars on the window might make a better puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="travel-by-fiat">Travel by Fiat</h3>

<p>Normally, the player moves from room to room under his own steam, by
typing GO NORTH (or simply N) and so on. Once in a while, you may want
to create a puzzle in which the player will be magically whisked from
one room to another by taking some other action. This is easy to do. For
example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of rubbing the magic lamp:\n\tsay &quot;You are engulfed in a cloud of sweet-smelling pink smoke! When you emerge, coughing, you find that your surroundings have changed.&quot;;\n\tnow the player is in the Harem.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of rubbing the magic lamp:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You are engulfed in a cloud of sweet-smelling pink smoke! When you emerge, coughing, you find that your surroundings have changed.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player is in the Harem.</div>
</div>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>Real rooms often have windows. Windows have some interesting
features. When you look through a window, you’ll normally see what’s on
the other side. If the window is open, you may also be able to climb
through it. (Or not.) A window is normally in two rooms, like a door.
And if the room on one side of a window is lighted, it’s very unlikely
that the room on the other side will be a dark room. (See <a href="#dark-rooms">Dark Rooms</a> for more.)</p>

<p>The easiest way to make a window that the player can actually climb
through is to make it a door. This will handle the player’s travel
automatically, and will also keep the two sides of the window “in sync”
with respect to whether they’re open or closed. Since Inform doesn’t
understand “climb through”, we’ll also create a new action to let the
player use the window:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Lab is a room. &quot;Welcome to the Test Lab. Many devious tests are conducted here. There&apos;s a wide window in the north wall.&quot;\n\nThe Porch is a room. &quot;There&apos;s a wide window in the south wall.&quot;\n\nThe wide window is a door. The wide window is scenery. The wide window is north of the Lab and south of the Porch.\n\nClimbing through is an action applying to one thing. Understand &quot;climb through [something]&quot;, &quot;climb in [something]&quot;, &quot;climb out [something]&quot;, and &quot;climb out of [something]&quot; as climbing through.\n\nCheck climbing through:\n\tif the noun is not a door:\n\t\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t climb through [a noun]!&quot; instead;\n\totherwise:\n\t\ttry entering the noun instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Lab is a room. "Welcome to the Test Lab. Many devious tests are conducted here. There's a wide window in the north wall."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Porch is a room. "There's a wide window in the south wall."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The wide window is a door. The wide window is scenery. The wide window is north of the Lab and south of the Porch.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Climbing through is an action applying to one thing. Understand "climb through [something]", "climb in [something]", "climb out [something]", and "climb out of [something]" as climbing through.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check climbing through:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is not a door:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You can't climb through [a noun]!" instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try entering the noun instead.</div>
</div>

<p>The commands LOOK THROUGH WINDOW and LOOK IN WINDOW cause Inform to
run the SEARCH action. However, LOOK OUT WINDOW and LOOK OUT OF WINDOW
aren’t understood. We can use an Instead rule to write a description of
whatever is on the far side of the window, and add an Understand
directive that will give the player two more ways to look through the
window.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of searching the wide window:\n\tif the location is the Porch:\n\t\tsay &quot;There seems to be a laboratory in there, but you can&apos;t make out any details.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;Through the window you can see the porch, but the view isn&apos;t good enough for you to make out any details.&quot;\n\nUnderstand &quot;look out of [something]&quot; and &quot;look out [something]&quot; as searching.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of searching the wide window:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the location is the Porch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There seems to be a laboratory in there, but you can't make out any details.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Through the window you can see the porch, but the view isn't good enough for you to make out any details."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "look out of [something]" and "look out [something]" as searching.</div>
</div>

<p>If we wanted to mention any large objects that would naturally be
visible through the window, such as a rocket on a launching pad, we can
create them as distant scenery, using the techniques shown earlier in
this chapter. Another refinement, which you may want to try working out
for yourself, would be to make the “look out of” action different from
the “look in” action, so that the player can look out the window only
when in an interior-type location, and can look in the window only when
in an exterior-type location. Depending on how your rooms are laid out,
this might be accomplished using <a
href="#regions">Regions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="you-cant-go-that-way.">“You can’t go that way.”</h3>

<p>A player who tries, in a certain room, to go in a direction for which
there is no map connection in that room, will be told, “You can’t go
that way.” This message has one advantage: It’s perfectly clear. The
player knows not to bother any more trying to go that direction in that
room. But it’s not very descriptive. Also, in an open outdoor setting
such as a field, being told “You can’t go that way” is unrealistic and
rather silly. Fortunately, it’s easy to write more interesting
replacement messages:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of going nowhere from Forest Path:\n\tsay &quot;You take a few steps into the forest, but deciding it might not be safe, you return to the path.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of going nowhere from Forest Path:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You take a few steps into the forest, but deciding it might not be safe, you return to the path."</div>
</div>

<p>Note that this rule says “going nowhere <em>from</em>”. Writing it as
“going nowhere <em>in</em>” won’t work. However, there are other
situations in which the “going &hellip; in” action is needed, and the “going
&hellip; from” action won’t work. The basic concept is, “going from” assumes
that the action of going has succeeded. In the code above, the player
has succeeded … in going nowhere.</p>

<p>This code is fine as far as it goes, but the player will get the same
output in response to UP or DOWN, which is not so sensible. We might
customize our “You can’t go that way” messages further like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of going up in Forest Path:\n\tsay &quot;The trees have no branches low enough for you to reach them.&quot;\n\nInstead of going down in Forest Path:\n\tsay &quot;There are no gaping holes or open mineshafts in the vicinity.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of going up in Forest Path:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The trees have no branches low enough for you to reach them."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going down in Forest Path:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There are no gaping holes or open mineshafts in the vicinity."</div>
</div>

<p>Depending on the features of the rooms in your map, you may want to
write custom “You can’t go that way” messages that are different for
each room. But we’ll borrow an idea from the next section, on Regions,
to suggest a more streamlined approach. After telling Inform that Forest
Path, Canyon View, and Haunted Grove are all in a region called Forest
Area, we can write Instead rules that will apply across the entire
region:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of going nowhere from the Forest Area:\n\tsay &quot;You take a few steps into the forest, but deciding it might not be safe, you return to the path.&quot;\n\t\nInstead of going up in the Forest Area:\n\tsay &quot;The trees have no branches low enough for you to reach them.&quot;\n\t\nInstead of going down in the Forest Area:\n\tsay &quot;There are no gaping holes or open mineshafts in the vicinity.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of going nowhere from the Forest Area:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You take a few steps into the forest, but deciding it might not be safe, you return to the path."</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going up in the Forest Area:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The trees have no branches low enough for you to reach them."</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going down in the Forest Area:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There are no gaping holes or open mineshafts in the vicinity."</div>
</div>

<p>If you’re using the Secret Doors extension, you’ll have to do a bit
of extra work, because a secret door that hasn’t been revealed will
produce the default “You can’t go that way” message, <em>not</em> the
custom message you’ve written using an Instead rule like those above.
But writing a custom message can be used to give the player an
in-the-game clue. Following the code about the secret door in the Doors
section, above, you could add something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before going through the oak door when the oak door is unrevealed:\n\tsay &quot;You bump your nose on the oak paneling. Odd -- you had somehow absent-mindedly thought there ought to be a door there.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before going through the oak door when the oak door is unrevealed:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You bump your nose on the oak paneling. Odd -- you had somehow absent-mindedly thought there ought to be a door there.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>This message will be output if the player tries to go north through
the secret door before it’s revealed.</p>

<h3 id="duplicate-exits-twisty-connections">Duplicate Exits &amp; Twisty Connections</h3>

<p>Let’s suppose we’ve created a room that’s described like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Cellar is down from the Kitchen. &quot;The low ceiling of this little room is festooned with cobwebs, and the floor is dirt. A rough doorway leads east, and the stairs up to the kitchen are built into the north wall.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Cellar is down from the Kitchen. "The low ceiling of this little room is festooned with cobwebs, and the floor is dirt. A rough doorway leads east, and the stairs up to the kitchen are built into the north wall."</div>
</div>

<p>Because we’ve said the Cellar is down from the Kitchen, Inform
creates an up/down map connection between the two rooms. But you’ll
notice that the room description (in the interest of adding detail)
mentions that the stairs are to the north. If the player should try to
go north, though, she’ll be told, “You can’t go that way.” This is not
too friendly, but it’s easy to fix:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of going north in the Cellar, try going up.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of going north in the Cellar, try going up.</div>
</div>

<p>By the way, Inform insists that we write this as “try going up”, not
simply as “go up”. The reason is because there’s no guarantee that the
action will succeed. Going up might not work for some reason: Maybe the
stairs will collapse, trapping the player in the cellar! That’s why the
word “try” is used so often in Inform code.</p>

<p>Sometimes we need to make a one-way connection between rooms.
Possibly there’s a chute in the cellar, which the player can go down in
order to reach the cavern &ndash; but once in the cavern, will be unable to
climb back up the chute. It would be friendly to the player to mention
that the chute looks a bit treacherous. (This example is similar to one
of the first puzzles in Zork, by the way.) There are two ways to do this
in Inform.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Cellar is down from the Kitchen. &quot;The low ceiling of this little room is festooned with cobwebs, and the floor is dirt. A rough doorway leads east, and the stairs up to the kitchen are built into the north wall. In the southeast corner is a hole that looks wide enough to enter, but if you climb down it, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to get back up.&quot;\n\nThe Spider-Infested Cavern is down from the Cellar. &quot;Spiders! Thousands of them!&quot; Up from the Spider-Infested Cavern is nowhere.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Cellar is down from the Kitchen. "The low ceiling of this little room is festooned with cobwebs, and the floor is dirt. A rough doorway leads east, and the stairs up to the kitchen are built into the north wall. In the southeast corner is a hole that looks wide enough to enter, but if you climb down it, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to get back up."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Spider-Infested Cavern is down from the Cellar. "Spiders! Thousands of them!" Up from the Spider-Infested Cavern is nowhere.</div>
</div>

<p>Here we’ve created a one-way map connection by telling Inform that
the up direction from the cavern leads nowhere. The other way to do it
would be with an Instead rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Spider-Infested Cavern is down from the Cellar. &quot;Spiders! Thousands of them!&quot;\n\nInstead of going up in the Spider-Infested Cavern, say &quot;The hole is too steep for you to climb back up.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Spider-Infested Cavern is down from the Cellar. "Spiders! Thousands of them!"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going up in the Spider-Infested Cavern, say "The hole is too steep for you to climb back up."</div>
</div>

<p>The advantage of using an Instead rule is that you can tell the
player exactly what the travel problem is.</p>

<p>In the original game of Adventure, some of the rooms were connected
not in the normal way, but with “twisty” connections. One of the main
puzzles in the game involved figuring out how to draw a reliable map.
This type of puzzle is not used much in modern games. For one thing,
players find it annoying and not fun. But once in a while you may want
to create a connection between two rooms that is a bit twisty rather
than straight. For instance, the room description might tell the player,
“You can go east around the corner of the building.” To return after
going east, you might need to go north. Here’s how to create this type
of connection:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Deeper in the Cellar is east of the Cellar. &quot;This little room smells awful.&quot;\nThe Cellar is north of Deeper in the Cellar.\nWest of Deeper in the Cellar is nowhere.\nSouth of the Cellar is nowhere.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Deeper in the Cellar is east of the Cellar. "This little room smells awful."</div>
<div class="codeline">The Cellar is north of Deeper in the Cellar.</div>
<div class="codeline">West of Deeper in the Cellar is nowhere.</div>
<div class="codeline">South of the Cellar is nowhere.</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that we have to tell Inform that after going east from the
Cellar, we can’t get back where we started by going west &ndash; we have to go
north. That’s why the two “nowhere” lines have been added. This makes
the model world a little more realistic. It’s also a good idea if you’re
including <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Exit%20Lister-v11.i7x">Exit Lister by Eric Eve</a>. This extension will list the exits
from every room in the status line &ndash; and if a room with only one actual
exit shows two exits on the status line, the player may get a little
  confused.</p>

<p>For a more concise syntax that will produce “dog-leg” connections
between rooms, see <a href="../examples/port_royal2.html">Example 7: Port Royal 2</a> in the Documentation. We
can do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`East of the Cellar is north of Deeper in the Cellar.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">East of the Cellar is north of Deeper in the Cellar.</div>
</div>

<p>An even more twisty and confusing map connection is to have one of
the exits of a room lead back into the same room. To do that, you would
write something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`East of Deeper in the Cellar is Deeper in the Cellar.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">East of Deeper in the Cellar is Deeper in the Cellar.</div>
</div>

<h4 id="hallways-with-lots-of-doors">Hallways with Lots of Doors</h4>

<p>A different type of mapping challenge arises when the story calls for
a long hallway from which several doors lead off in the same direction.
If the hallway runs from east to west, for example, there may be four or
five doors that are notionally to the north, and four or five more that
are to the south. There are a couple of ways to deal with this
challenge, each with its own strengths and limitations.</p>

<p>First, you can break the long hallway up into several separate
“rooms” (East End of Hallway, Center of Hallway, and West End of
Hallway, for instance), each of which has its own exits to the north and
south. If you do this, you’ll probably want to consider what happens if
the player drops something large at one end of the hallway and then
walks down to the other end. As explained earlier in this chapter, it’s
possible to make objects visible from a distance, so this is not a huge
challenge, it’s just extra work to set it up.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can skip (in this one room) the notion of N/S/E/W
travel commands. If you give each door a distinctive appearance, you can
invite the player to GO THROUGH DOOR 16 as a method of traveling. Here
is an example that shows how to do precisely that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Long Hallway is a room. &quot;The hallway runs from east to west. In the north wall are three doors, numbered 16, 17, and 18.&quot; North of the Hallway is nowhere.\n\nDoor 16 is scenery in the Hallway. &quot;To the door is nailed a brass number 16.&quot; Understand &quot;number&quot; as door 16\n\nDoor 17 is scenery in the Hallway. &quot;To the door is nailed a brass number 17.&quot; Understand &quot;number&quot; as door 17.\n\nDoor 18 is scenery in the Hallway. &quot;To the door is nailed a brass number 18.&quot; Understand &quot;number&quot; as door 18.\n\nRoom 16 is a room. &quot;You are now in the featureless Room 16 The door is to the south.&quot; South of Room 16 is the Hallway.\n\nRoom 17 is a room. &quot;You are now in the featureless Room 17.

<h3 id="changing-the-map-during-the-game">Changing the Map During the Game</h3>

<p>In most of the games you may write, the model world will work the way
you want it to if you create connections between rooms at the beginning
of the game (that is, when creating the rooms in your source) and then
leave the connections alone. But once in a while, you may want a
connection between rooms to disappear while the game is being played &ndash;
maybe because the rooms are in a cave complex and there has been a
cave-in blocking a tunnel. Or maybe a magic door has suddenly appeared
in a room, creating a connection where there wasn’t one before. The
magic door might even have a mind of its own, and wander off again.
(Inform doesn’t allow doors to be moved around during the game; if you
want a magic door to move around, you’ll have to write some extra code
to create an ordinary object that responds to the player’s commands as
if it were a door.)</p>

<p>To get rid of an exit from a room, change that direction of the room
to nowhere. (It’s usually a good idea to do this to both sides of the
connection between rooms, just in case there’s another route the player
can use to get around to the other side of the blocked exit.) To restore
an exit or create a new one, change the exit so that it points to the
room that is the destination.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple test game that shows how to do it. In this game, if
the player tries the command UP before the Tree House has been visited,
the only result will be a nudge (“You gaze speculatively&hellip;”) Once the
tree has been climbed, however, the UP command will work.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest Path is a room. &quot;Tall old trees surround you.

<p>Next we’ll look at a somewhat artificial example that has one or two
added features. In this short game there are two north-south connections
(between the Living Room and the Kitchen, and between the Bathroom and
the Bedroom), but only one of them will exist at any time, depending on
which button you push. To make the changes easier to test, I’ve put the
buttons on a backdrop, so that they’re always present no matter what
room you’re in. I also included  <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Exit%20Lister-v11.i7x">Exit Lister by Eric Eve</a>, which will display the
current exits in the status line. Notice that the status line will be
updated each time you press a button.</p>

</div>

<p>This neat little trick won’t work with doors, unfortunately. Inform
has rigid ideas about how doors work. It’s possible to make a door seem
to disappear during the game, even though it’s still present. Doing this
is awkward and error-prone, but the place to start would be with the
Secret Doors extension, which is discussed earlier in this chapter. A
better approach might be, as mentioned earlier, to create an ordinary
thing that responds to the user’s commands as if it were a door.</p>

<h3 id="regions">Regions</h3>

<p>As explained on <a href="../WI_3.html/#section_4">WI 3.4: Regions and the index map</a>), using regions is a nice way
to keep a larger map organized. After you’ve defined some regions,
you’ll also be able to use some of Inform’s world-building features more
easily. This is because you can test what region the player is in, and
do something with the information. For instance, after creating a region
called Forest, you could do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn when in the Forest:\n\tsay &quot;[one of]A bird chirps.[or]You hear a soft rustling in the bushes.[or]A butterfly flits past you.[at random]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn when in the Forest:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]A bird chirps.[or]You hear a soft rustling in the bushes.[or]A butterfly flits past you.[at random]".</div>
</div>

<p>(The elements inserted in square brackets in a double-quoted text
give Inform instructions about how to print out the text. In the example
above, the bracketed insertions allow Inform to produce a text output
that changes. For more on this topic, see “Text Insertions” in Chapter 8
of the <em>Handbook</em>.) Creating a region and adding rooms to it is
simple. You do it like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest is a region. Forest Path, Haunted Grove, and Canyon View are in Forest.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest is a region. Forest Path, Haunted Grove, and Canyon View are in Forest.</div>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve created a region, the Inform IDE will color the rooms of
the region to match one another in the Index Map. This is one of several
features in the IDE that will become more useful as your story gets
larger. At right is a simple map based on some rooms we’ve used earlier
in this chapter. There are two regions, one (the Great Outdoors) colored
green and the other (Within the Stone House) colored blue. The room
where the player character is located at the start of the story is
Forest Path; it’s surrounded by a darker outline. The room called
Low-Ceilinged Attic is shown in the upper level because it’s mapped
upward from Inside the Stone House (abbreviated IS on the map).</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/map_of_the_world.png"></div>

<p>I’ve found that it’s safer to define a region <em>after</em> creating
the rooms that will be in it &ndash; that is, the region definition should be
placed below the rooms in the source code. This is because the room
object is created the first time it’s mentioned in the code. Inform
understands that the only things that can be in regions are rooms, so it
will add a new room when you first create the region, if it doesn’t
already know about that room. Some of the ways that you can write
sentences that create rooms will confuse Inform if it already knows
about a room that has that same name. Also, you need to be sure to use
exactly the same room name in the region list that you use when creating
the room. If there’s a typo in the room name in the region list, Inform
will cheerfully create a second, featureless room whose name has a typo
in it. This can lead to hard-to-find bugs.</p>

<p>For consistency, and to make your code easier to read, I suggest
always using the word “Area” in the names of your regions. So I would
edit the code above to read like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Forest Area is a region. Forest Path, Haunted Grove, and Canyon View are in Forest Area.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Forest Area is a region. Forest Path, Haunted Grove, and Canyon View are in Forest Area.</div>
</div>

<p>You can create one region that’s entirely within another region, but
Inform won’t let two regions overlap one another. When creating a region
that’s contained in a larger region, it’s important to mention the rooms
in only one region definition. The following won’t work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Room1 is a room. Room2 is a room. Room3 is a room. Room4 is a room. Room5 is a room.\n\nThe Big Area is a region. Room1, Room2, Room3, Room4, and Room5 are in the Big Area.\n\nThe Little Area is a region. Room1, Room2, and Room3 are in the Little Area. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Room1 is a room. Room2 is a room. Room3 is a room. Room4 is a room. Room5 is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Big Area is a region. Room1, Room2, Room3, Room4, and Room5 are in the Big Area.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Little Area is a region. Room1, Room2, and Room3 are in the Little Area. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s how to get the desired result:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Room1 is a room. Room2 is a room. Room3 is a room. Room4 is a room. Room5 is a room.\n\nThe Little Area is a region. Room1, Room2, and Room3 are in the Little Area.\n\nThe Big Area is a region. The Little Area, Room4, and Room5 are in the Big Area.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Room1 is a room. Room2 is a room. Room3 is a room. Room4 is a room. Room5 is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Little Area is a region. Room1, Room2, and Room3 are in the Little Area.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Big Area is a region. The Little Area, Room4, and Room5 are in the Big Area.</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that the Little Area is defined before the Big Area. This is
so we can refer to the Little Area in the region definition for the Big
Area. If we try to do it in the other order, Inform will think “Little
Area” is a room &ndash; because anything in a region has to be a room. It will
then get confused when we tell it that Little Area is a region. If you
do it as shown directly above, it will work.</p>

<p>If you need to create regions (that is, groups of rooms) that overlap
or that change during the course of the game, the workaround is fairly
simple: Don’t use defined regions at all. Instead, use properties. For
example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A room can be cursed or uncursed. A room is usually uncursed.\n\nEvery turn when the player is in a cursed room:\n\tsay &quot;Oooh, scary!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A room can be cursed or uncursed. A room is usually uncursed.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the player is in a cursed room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Oooh, scary!"</div>
</div>

<p>At any point in the game, you can change a room from cursed to
uncursed or vice-versa with a single line of code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the Dormitory is uncursed.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the Dormitory is uncursed.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="backdrops">Backdrops</h3>

<p>Rooms in Inform are not built out of anything &ndash; they’re just empty,
featureless containers that you can move objects into and out of. In
particular, you might expect that a room would have a ceiling, walls,
and a floor. But if you try X CEILING, X FLOOR, or X WALL in your game,
you’ll be told, “You can’t see any such thing.” Likewise, in an outdoor
setting, X SKY and X GROUND won’t work. Most players will probably
understand this convention, and won’t even think to try interacting with
the walls, ceiling, and floor. But if you mention a wall, ceiling,
floor, sky, or ground in the room description, creating it as scenery
would be a polite thing to do, since players will usually try to examine
(or pick up) anything that’s mentioned.</p>

<p>Scenery is always in one specific room, but Inform also provides a
special kind of scenery called a <em>backdrop.</em> A backdrop object is
unusual because it can be in several places at once.</p>

<p>An easy way to add a little realism to your game is to use backdrops
to create sky, ground, ceiling, floor, and so on only where they’re
needed:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The sky is a backdrop. &quot;A clear and cloudless blue.&quot;\nThe sky is in the Great Outdoors.\n\nThe ground is a backdrop. &quot;It&apos;s rather dirty.”\nUnderstand &quot;dirt&quot; as the ground. The ground is in the Great Outdoors.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  <div class="codeline">The sky is a backdrop. "A clear and cloudless blue."</div>
  <div class="codeline">The sky is in the Great Outdoors.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The ground is a backdrop. "It's rather dirty.”</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "dirt" as the ground. The ground is in the Great Outdoors.</div>
</div>

<p>Now if the player types X SKY in any room in the Great Outdoors, the
game will reply, “A clear and cloudless blue.” That’s a definite
improvement! (Note that “The description is” is not required for the
descriptions of backdrops.) As we add indoor rooms, perhaps in a castle,
they won’t be in the Great Outdoors region, so a player who tries X SKY
while in the castle will be told, very appropriately, “You can’t see any
such thing.”</p>

<p>Backdrops are more versatile than you might expect. A backdrop could
be used, for instance, to create a river that’s present in several
rooms. In one game I wanted a windowsill (a supporter &ndash; see <a
href="#containers-supporters">Containers &amp; Supporters</a>) that could be reached from both
inside and outside the room. At Emily Short’s suggestion, I created the
window as a backdrop, so that it could be in two rooms at once, and then
made the windowsill a part of the window.</p>

<h4 id="removing-a-backdrop">Removing a Backdrop</h4>

<p>Getting rid of a backdrop entirely during play is easy. If we’ve
created, for instance, some thick fog, when the player does something to
cause the wind to blow, we can write:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the fog is nowhere;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the fog is nowhere;</div>
</div>

<p>Removing a backdrop from certain rooms while leaving it in other
rooms is slightly tricky, however. Inform has no command for this, but
we can create a routine that will do it. What we need to do is give all
of the rooms where the backdrop is to be found a property. Since we’re
going to create some fog, we’ll allow rooms to be foggy or not foggy.
We’ll also give the player a giant bellows. Pumping the bellows will
dispel the fog, but only from the current room.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A room can be foggy or not foggy.

<h3 id="dark-rooms">Dark Rooms</h3>

<p>The very first interactive fiction, a game called Adventure, was set
in a cave. Like most caves, it was dark. As long as the player was
carrying a lantern, the game could be played in what we now consider the
normal way. But any room where there wasn’t a light source would be
pitch-dark.</p>

<p>In a dark room the player can’t examine anything, won’t be able to
see things lying on the floor, won’t be able to LOOK to read the room
description, most likely can’t read what’s written in books and on
pieces of paper, and may not be able to find an exit reliably so as to
go back to a lighted room. You should still be able to take an inventory
of the objects you’re carrying while in a dark room, and (depending on
how the game is written) you may be able to touch things in the
room.</p>

<p>Today, the rooms in most games have
light, so no lantern is needed. Rooms in Inform are always lighted
unless you state otherwise.</p>

<p><a href="../WI_3.html#section_15">WI 3.15: Light
and darkness</a> explains how to create dark rooms and how to create
objects (such as torches and flashlights) that are lit. It’s a
convention of IF that dark rooms are completely dark, but <a href="../examples/zorn_of_zorna.html">Example 347:
Zorn of Zorna</a> shows how to create a system in which the amount of
light in a room can be dim.</p>

<p>A dark room to which you have to bring a light source is a standard
type of puzzle, and most players will have no trouble figuring out what
they need to do. You might consider some variation that makes it harder
to bring a light source. Two obvious ideas are a flashlight for which
you have to find batteries and a candle whose flame blows out due to
gusts of wind. Both of these have been used in a lot of games, though.
To create a really good dark room puzzle, you’ll need to come up with
something more imaginative &ndash; perhaps a glass jar full of fireflies, a
secret lever that opens a louvered skylight, or a friendly ghost who
glows in the dark and can be persuaded to follow you.</p>

<p>To create an object in Inform that provides light, all you need to do
is say that it does:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the torch is lit;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the torch is lit;</div>
</div>

<p>In a real game, you might want the torch to burn out after a fixed
number of moves, making a timed puzzle. Or finding the matches with
which to light the torch might be a separate puzzle. If the object is
lit from the start of the game, you’d do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The ghost is a person. The ghost is lit.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The ghost is a person. The ghost is lit.</div>
</div>

<p>But what if the player is in a dark room, and you want her to be able
to find the switch so as to turn on the light? This situation can trip
up the novice author, and here’s why: Inform assumes that when things
are in a dark room, the player can’t sense or manipulate them. If the
light switch is in the dark, the player will never be able to use
it.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example that shows how to get around this problem. It
involves using a special rule to add the light switch to scope. Also
included are customized rules about how to announce darkness and &ndash; much
more important for this example &ndash; how to print the description of a dark
room. These methods are described in <a href="../WI_18.html#section_19">WI 18.19: Printing the announcement of darkness</a> and <a href="../WI_18.html#section_22">WI 18.22: Printing the description of a dark room</a>. We need a special way to print the description of the room
we’re calling the Library when it’s dark, because otherwise the player
will have no idea that there’s a light switch in the room. “Guess what
you can do in a dark room” is a very unfair type of puzzle.</p>

</div>

<p>If you look closely at the code above, you’ll see a couple of other
refinements as well. The game starts in the Library (since there’s only
one room), and we don’t want the message about groping around and
finding the light switch to appear at the very beginning of the game. So
we create a counter (a variable) called “library darkness count.” At the
beginning of the game, this is 0 &ndash; but the first time the description of
a dark room is printed, the counter is increased to 1. Thereafter, when
the player uses the LOOK command in the Library, she’ll discover the
light switch.</p>

<p>I also used an Instead rule so that if the player tries SWITCH OFF
LAMP, the command will be redirected to SWITCH OFF LIGHT-SWITCH. This
keeps all of the handling of the lamp’s on/off condition in one place &ndash;
in the switch. The switch is an Inform <strong><a href="#Ref_device">device</a></strong>, which as explained in Chapter 3 is one
of the kinds of object that Inform allows you to create.</p>

<h4 id="backdrops-in-dark-rooms">Backdrops in Dark Rooms</h4>

<p>Inform assumes, by default, that a backdrop is something that a
player will want to look at. For that reason, backdrops are not present
in dark rooms, even when you’ve written code that states the backdrop is
everywhere. If your game includes a backdrop that the player may want to
smell, you’ll need to do a little extra work. Here’s how to create a
backdrop that can be smelled even in a dark room:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest is a room. &quot;All around you stretches the Great Northern Forest. To the east is a cave.&quot;\n\nThe Cave is east of the Forest. The Cave is a dark room.\n\nThe air is a backdrop. It is everywhere.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Cave is east of the Forest. The Cave is a dark room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The air is a backdrop. It is everywhere. The description of the air is "You can't see the air!"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of smelling the air:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Cave:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Dank and foul.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Fresh."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After deciding the scope of the player when in darkness:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;place the air in scope.</div>
</div>

<p>The “After deciding the scope of the player” rule insures that the
air will be present in the Cave.</p>

<h3 id="seemingly-identical-rooms">Seemingly Identical Rooms</h3>

<p>Once in a while, you might want to design an area of the map in which
there are several rooms that have the same name and description (such as
“You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.”).
Internally, in your code, each of your rooms has to have a unique name
of its own. But it’s easy enough to give several rooms the same printed
name and description:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Land1 is a room. &quot;The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides.&quot; The printed name of Land1 is &quot;Landscape&quot;. \n\nLand2 is south of Land1. &quot;The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides.&quot; The printed name of Land2 is &quot;Landscape&quot;. \n\nLand3 is west of Land1. &quot;The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides.&quot; The printed name of Land3 is &quot;Landscape&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Land1 is a room. "The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides." The printed name of Land1 is "Landscape". </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Land2 is south of Land1. "The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides." The printed name of Land2 is "Landscape". </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Land3 is west of Land1. "The landscape stretches out to the horizon on all sides." The printed name of Land3 is "Landscape".</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;and so on. To the player, all of these rooms will initially appear
to be identical. But as in the original game of Adventure, from which
the line about twisty little passages is borrowed, the player can easily
drop a different object in each room and then draw a map based on the
locations of the various objects and the routes between them. When I
find myself (against my better judgment) designing a puzzle of this
sort, I usually try to come up with a plausible reason why the player
character wouldn’t want to drop anything, such as, “Better not. You
might never be able to find it again.” This at least forces the player
to come up with a fresh approach to mapping the region. It’s not a very
original puzzle, but you might be tempted to try something of the sort,
so it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<h3 id="floorless-rooms">Floorless Rooms</h3>

<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, when the player uses
the DROP command to get rid of objects that are being carried, the
convention of IF is that the objects end up on the floor. This is
usually a sensible way for objects to behave &ndash; but what if the “room” is
the top of a tree?</p>

<p>Creating a floorless room turns out to be very easy:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A floorless room is a kind of room. A floorless room has a room called the drop-location.\n\nThe Forest Path is a room. &quot;Tall old trees surround you. That magnificent oak, for instance.&quot;\n\nThe old oak tree is scenery in Forest Path. &quot;Plenty of low-hanging branches. You could probably climb it.&quot;\n\nInstead of climbing the old oak tree:\n\ttry going up.\n\nTop of the Oak Tree is up from the Forest Path. &quot;The view from here is inspiring!&quot; Top of the Oak Tree is a floorless room.

A floorless room has a room called the drop-location.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Forest Path is a room. "Tall old trees surround you. That magnificent oak, for instance."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The old oak tree is scenery in Forest Path. "Plenty of low-hanging branches. You could probably climb it."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of climbing the old oak tree:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try going up.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Top of the Oak Tree is up from the Forest Path. "The view from here is inspiring!" Top of the Oak Tree is a floorless room. The drop-location of Top of the Oak Tree is Forest Path.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After dropping something in a floorless room (called F):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the noun to the drop-location of F;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] drop[s] out of sight."</div>
</div>

<p>The only thing you need to be careful of, with this code, is that
every floorless room <em>must</em> have its drop-location defined. If
you forget to do this, things that are dropped will end up (oddly
enough) in the starting location of the game &ndash; the first room defined in
your source.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-a-room-visited">When Is a Room “visited”?</h3>

<p>In Chapter 1 we introduced the idea of verbose and brief mode. When a
game is in verbose mode, the text of each room’s description property is
printed each time the player enters the room. In brief mode, however,
the description is printed only the first time the player enters a room.
Thereafter, the description is printed only if the player uses the LOOK
command. (Note that other aspects of the room’s full description, namely
a list of the non-scenery objects that are in the room, will always be
printed when the player enters a visited room, even if the game is in
brief mode.)</p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, only the room where the player
character starts the game is marked as visited. All other rooms are
unvisited. What’s interesting is that a room is marked as visited only
<em>after</em> its description property is printed for the first time.
This fact allows us to change the room description after the first time
the player reads it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Throne Room is north of the Entry Hall. &quot;This high-vaulted chamber is grandiose in the extreme. [if unvisited]Your first sight of its magnificence quite takes your breath away. [end if]Each of the dozens of richly woven tapestries lining the walls surely cost more than all of the shabby hovels and mangy livestock in the humble village where you were born.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Throne Room is north of the Entry Hall. "This high-vaulted chamber is grandiose in the extreme. [if unvisited]Your first sight of its magnificence quite takes your breath away. [end if]Each of the dozens of richly woven tapestries lining the walls surely cost more than all of the shabby hovels and mangy livestock in the humble village where you were born."</div>
</div>

<p>Here, the sentence about the view taking your breath away will appear
only the first time the Throne Room is seen.</p>

<p>If the game is in superbrief mode, the description property won’t
print even on the player’s first visit. This mode is not used by most
players, because room descriptions generally contain useful information!
But it’s important to understand that you, the author, don’t get to
control whether the player will see the wonderful room descriptions
you’ve written.</p>

<p>Or rather … there’s a way to control it, though it would be rude.
Let’s suppose that something happens in a room in the course of the game
that changes a room so drastically that you’d like to change both its
description and its printed name. Perhaps there has been an explosion in
the kitchen. The actual name of the room object won’t change &ndash; it’s
still called Kitchen in the source code. But now we want it to be shown
in the game’s output as “Ruins of the Kitchen”. This is easy. As part of
the code that produces the explosion (whatever that might be), we write
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the printed name of the Kitchen is &quot;Ruins of the Kitchen&quot;;\n\nnow the description of the Kitchen is &quot;About five tons of icky cake batter have splattered everywhere!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the printed name of the Kitchen is "Ruins of the Kitchen";</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">now the description of the Kitchen is "About five tons of icky cake batter have splattered everywhere!"</div>
</div>

<p>The existence of the BRIEF and SUPERBRIEF commands, however, means
that you can’t be certain your players will ever read about the cake
batter. As part of your explosion in the kitchen, then, you could
include, “now the Kitchen is unvisited;”. But if the player has
cavalierly switched to superbrief mode, that won’t work: They still
won’t see the new description. Arguably, this is their problem, not
yours. But if you find it an insupportable intrusion on your authorial
prerogatives, you can get rid of brief and superbrief modes entirely,
forcing the player to see the complete room description each time a room
is entered. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use full-length room descriptions.\nUnderstand the command &quot;brief&quot; as something new.\nUnderstand the command &quot;superbrief&quot; as something new.\n\nMode-change-refusing is an action out of world, applying to nothing. Understand &quot;brief&quot; and &quot;superbrief&quot; as mode-change-refusing.\n\nCarry out mode-change-refusing:\n\tsay &quot;Sorry -- this game is always in verbose mode.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use full-length room descriptions.</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out mode-change-refusing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Sorry -- this game is always in verbose mode."</div>
</div>
<h3 id="more-about-room-descriptions">More About Room Descriptions</h3>

<p>We’ve already seen (in the section on “Backdrops,” earlier in this
chapter) a few examples of rooms whose description can change. These
changes were produced by using square brackets to insert bits of code in
the room description itself. This can be done with an if-test, as shown
above in the example of the Throne Room, or with a [one of] insertion.
There are other possibilities as well. These techniques are discussed in
more detail in the section on “Text Insertions” in Chapter 9 of the
<em>Handbook</em>, “Phrasing &amp; Punctuation,” but here’s an example
of each technique to get you started:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Bog is south of the Desolate Moor. &quot;The ground here is quite moist[if the fog is in the Bog], and the fog is thicker[otherwise]. A path extends out of the bog to the north[end if].&quot;\n\nThe Sunlit Clearing is east of the Bog. &quot;Sunlight streams down into this charming and cheerful space. [one of]Butterflies flit about you[or]A chipmunk scampers past[or]Songbirds twitter in the trees[at random].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Bog is south of the Desolate Moor. "The ground here is quite moist[if the fog is in the Bog], and the fog is thicker[otherwise]. A path extends out of the bog to the north[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Sunlit Clearing is east of the Bog. "Sunlight streams down into this charming and cheerful space. [one of]Butterflies flit about you[or]A chipmunk scampers past[or]Songbirds twitter in the trees[at random]."</div>
</div>

<p>There’s more to room descriptions than this, however. Each time the
player enters a new room or uses the LOOK action, Inform assembles a
text to print out. The room’s name is the first part of this text; it’s
followed by description you’ve written for the room. After printing out
your room description, Inform will mention anything in the room that it
considers interesting &ndash; mainly any visible objects that are not
scenery.</p>

<p>The rules that are used for assembling the rest of the text are
called the carry out looking rules. They’re complex, and this
<em>Handbook</em> is not the place to dissect them line by line.
Instead, we’ll mention a few of the things that you may want to do to
customize the appearance of your game. You may often want to control how
various objects are listed as part of the complete room description. A
large chunk of <a href="../WI_18.html">Chapter 18 of <em>Writing with Inform</em>, “Activities”</a>,
is devoted to this complex and useful topic, from <a href="../WI_18.html#section_9">WI 18.9: Deciding the
concealed possessions of something</a> through <a href="../WI_18.html#section_9">WI 18.28: Printing a locale
paragraph about</a>. Close study of these pages and the Examples that go
with them will give you plenty of ideas to experiment with.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways to control the way objects are
mentioned. We’ll start with this code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use the serial comma.\n\nThe Living Room is a room. &quot;Your comfy living room.&quot;\n\nThe paper clip is in the Living Room.\n\nBuffy the Labrador retriever is a female animal in the Living Room.\n\nThe sugar candy doll house is in the Living Room.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use the serial comma.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Living Room is a room. "Your comfy living room."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The paper clip is in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Buffy the Labrador retriever is a female animal in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The sugar candy doll house is in the Living Room.</div>
</div>

<p>The output reads like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Living Room</p>
<p>Your comfy living room.</p>
<p>You can see a paper clip, Buffy the Labrador retriever, and a sugar
candy doll house here.</p>
</div>

<p>Notice that the list of items that Inform has constructed is in a
separate paragraph. Also, notice that the items are listed in exactly
the order they were mentioned in the source code. (The statement, “Use
the serial comma,” puts a comma after the next-to-last item in the
list.)</p>

<p>Now we’ll add one sentence to the code for Buffy. This sentence will
be an <strong>initial appearance</strong> (explained more fully in
Chapter 3). This new sentence, beginning “Buffy the Labrador retriever
is lounging&hellip;”, is not a description. Only when we’re creating rooms
and scenery can we write a description that doesn’t start with the
phrase “The description is”. So Buffy has, as yet, no description; she
only has an initial appearance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Buffy the Labrador retriever is a female animal in the Living Room.\n&quot;Buffy the Labrador retriever is lounging here, shedding hair all over the place.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Buffy the Labrador retriever is a female animal in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">"Buffy the Labrador retriever is lounging here, shedding hair all over the place."</div>
</div>

<p>The initial description will remove Buffy from the list, and give her
her own paragraph in the output. Now the output reads like this:</p>

<p class="bold">Living Room</p>

<p>Your comfy living room.</p>

<p>Buffy the Labrador retriever is lounging here, shedding hair all over
the place.</p>

<p>You can also see a paper clip and a sugar candy doll house here.</p>

<p>Notice the word “also” in the last sentence. Inform has noticed that
there was a separate paragraph about Buffy before the basic list, so it
added an “also”.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll add a scenery supporter to the Living Room. (Containers
and supporters are discussed in Chapter 3, “Things.”) Since it’s
scenery, it won’t be mentioned as part of the list of objects in the
complete room description, so we’ll want to add a bit to the room
description property itself:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Living Room is a room. &quot;Your comfy living room, complete with a falling-apart coffee table from Particle Board Heaven.&quot;\n\nThe coffee table is a scenery supporter in the Living Room. The description is &quot;You really ought to replace it with something more upscale.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Living Room is a room. "Your comfy living room, complete with a falling-apart coffee table from Particle Board Heaven."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The coffee table is a scenery supporter in the Living Room. The description is "You really ought to replace it with something more upscale."</div>
</div>

<p>Adding the coffee table will have no effect on the way objects are
listed in the room. But if we make one more change, we’ll see something
new in the output. We’re going to put the paper clip on the coffee
table:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The paper clip is on the coffee table.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The paper clip is on the coffee table.</div>
</div>

<p>This changes the output significantly:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Living Room</p>

<p>Your comfy living room, complete with a falling-apart coffee table
from Particle Board Heaven.</p>

<p>On the coffee table is a paper clip.</p>

<p>Buffy the Labrador retriever is lounging here, shedding hair all over
the place.</p>

<p>You can also see a sugar candy doll house here.</p>
</div>

<p>This is Inform’s normal handling: A scenery supporter will be
mentioned in its own paragraph, <em>but only if something is on it.</em>
However, this is not true of scenery containers. The contents of a
container are presumed to be less immediately visible than what’s on a
supporter, so they won’t be mentioned unless the player actually looks
in (searches) the container.</p>

<p>Mentioning the paper clip as shown above is probably just fine &ndash;
there’s nothing very remarkable about a paper clip. But what if the
object on the table is the priceless Etruscan figurine Mandy has been
raving to you about throughout the first half of the game? In that case,
this would be dull:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p>On the coffee table is an Etruscan figurine.</p>
</div>

<p>Eric Eve has suggested a simple way to get a more dramatic output,
using the printing a locale paragraph about activity (see <a href="../WI_18.html#section_9">WI 18.28: Printing a locale
paragraph about</a>).</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for printing a locale paragraph about the coffee table when the Etruscan figurine is on the coffee table and the number of things on the coffee table is 1:\n\tnow the Etruscan figurine is mentioned;\n\tsay &quot;On the coffee table you espy the priceless Etruscan figurine Mandy has been raving about!&quot;;\n\tcontinue the activity. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing a locale paragraph about the coffee table when the Etruscan figurine is on the coffee table and the number of things on the coffee table is 1:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the Etruscan figurine is mentioned;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "On the coffee table you espy the priceless Etruscan figurine Mandy has been raving about!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the activity. </div>
</div>

<p>Or perhaps you want that dramatic sentence to print only the first
time the player enters the room rather than every time the figurine is
still standing in solitary splendor on the coffee table. In that case,
create a truth state (a true-false variable) that will shut off the
special output after its first occurrence:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Figurine-mentioned is a truth state that varies. Figurine-mentioned is false.\nRule for printing a locale paragraph about the coffee table when the Etruscan figurine is on the coffee table and figurine-mentioned is false:\n\tnow the Etruscan figurine is mentioned;\n\tnow figurine-mentioned is true;\n\tsay &quot;On the coffee table you espy the priceless Etruscan figurine Mandy has been raving about!&quot;;\n\tcontinue the activity.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Figurine-mentioned is a truth state that varies.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "On the coffee table you espy the priceless Etruscan figurine Mandy has been raving about!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the activity.</div>
</div>

<h2 id="chapter-3-things">Chapter 3: Things</h2>

<p>A lot of the fun of
interactive fiction comes from being able to pick up and use objects in
the model world. At the beginning of this chapter, you’ll learn how to
create things. Once you’ve started creating things, though, you’ll find
that leaving them lying around where players can just pick them up won’t
give players much of a challenge. We’ll also look at ways to hide things
in the model world, so that finding a useful object becomes a
puzzle.</p>

<p>Most of the things you’ll create in a game will have uses. Some kinds
of things (such as keys) already have uses that Inform understands. But
if you create a bicycle pump so that the player can blow up a flat tire,
you’ll also need to create an <em>action</em>, as described in Chapter 4
of the <em>Handbook,</em> so that the player can use the command INFLATE
TIRE WITH PUMP. Creating actions so that things become useful is an
important part of writing a good game.</p>

<p>Pretty much every object you create in your Inform game is a thing.
Computer science majors would tell you that “thing” is a base class &ndash; a
kind, in Inform’s terms &ndash; and that many other kinds, such as person and
door, <em>inherit</em> from the thing kind. But we don’t need to worry
about that jargon. In this <em>Handbook</em>, we’ll usually call an
object in your game a thing only when it isn’t any other kind of thing,
such as a door or container.</p>

<h3 id="creating-things">Creating Things</h3>

<p>The most basic way to create a new thing is to tell Inform that it
exists:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The paintbrush is a thing.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The paintbrush is a thing.</div>
</div>

<p>This is enough to create an object called the paintbrush. But as yet,
the paintbrush is not anywhere in the model world. That is, it won’t
appear anywhere when your players/readers encounter your game/story.
Sometimes this is what you want: You may need to create objects that are
offstage at the beginning of the game, so that your code can move them
onstage later. More often, you’ll write an assertion that will cause the
thing to appear in a certain place at the beginning of the game. You can
do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Tool Shed is a room.\nThe paintbrush is in the Tool Shed.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Tool Shed is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The paintbrush is in the Tool Shed.</div>
</div>

<p>Another way to do exactly the same thing is this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Tool Shed is a room.\nThe paintbrush is here.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Tool Shed is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The paintbrush is here.</div>
</div>

<p>I suggest not using “is here,” however. If you need to move
paragraphs or whole sections of your code around for any reason, or if
you forget how you’ve defined the paintbrush and add more code after the
Tool Shed assertion and before the sentence that creates the paintbrush,
bad things can happen. (That is, your code may acquire bugs.) It’s safer
always to tell Inform specifically where a thing is to be placed at the
beginning of the game. This is a safe way to create things, however:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a bowling ball.\nThe duchess wears a diamond tiara.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a bowling ball.</div>
<div class="codeline">The duchess wears a diamond tiara.</div>
</div>

<p>Inform will understand that both the bowling ball and the diamond
tiara are new things that need to be added to the model world. It will
also understand that the diamond tiara is <strong>wearable</strong> &ndash;
that it’s something characters can put on and take off.</p>

<p>Containers and supporters will be discussed in detail later in this
chapter. Briefly, a supporter is a thing that acts like a table, so
objects can be placed on it. This would also work well:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Tool Shed is a room.\nThe workbench is a supporter in the Tool Shed.\nThe screwdriver is on the workbench.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Tool Shed is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The workbench is a supporter in the Tool Shed.</div>
<div class="codeline">The screwdriver is on the workbench.</div>
</div>

<p>Now Inform knows that the screwdriver is a thing, and knows exactly
where to put it at the start of the game.</p>

<p>The most important thing about things is that the player can pick
them up and carry them around. This is not true of some other types of
objects: The player won’t be allowed to pick up a door or a person, for
example.</p>

<p>Inform knows almost nothing else about newly created things, though.
It doesn’t know the difference between a screwdriver and a bowling ball.
In order to have these two things behave in different ways in your game,
you’ll have to write some action-processing code. (To learn how to do
this, see Chapter 4 of the <em>Handbook</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="things-vs.-kinds">Things vs. Kinds</h3>

<p>New Inform writers sometimes get into trouble by using the word
“kind” when it’s not needed. This word has a special meaning in Inform.
It refers to types of objects &ndash; what traditional computer programmers
call “classes.” The usual reason to create kinds is so that you can
write code that will apply to several different objects, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A fruit is a kind of thing. The banana is a fruit. The orange is a fruit. The plum is a fruit. The apple is a fruit.\n\nBefore eating a fruit:\n\tsay &quot;You’re not hungry right now.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A fruit is a kind of thing. The banana is a fruit. The orange is a fruit. The plum is a fruit. The apple is a fruit.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before eating a fruit:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You’re not hungry right now." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>The Before rule shown above will apply when the player types EAT
ORANGE, or EAT PLUM, or EAT BANANA, or EAT APPLE. But if you should
later happen to create a peach and forget to tell Inform that the peach
is a fruit, the Before rule won’t be applied to EAT PEACH.</p>

<p>Here’s an example, adapted from a post on the newsgroup
rec.arts.int-fiction, of how you can get in trouble using the word
“kind” when you don’t need to:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A phaser is a kind of thing. \nA phaser can be either set to stun or set to kill. \nInstead of examining the phaser, say &quot;Your shiny Mark Five phaser. Dual setting - stun and kill. [if the phaser is set to kill]It is currently set to kill.[Otherwise]It is currently set to stun.&quot; \nA phaser is usually set to stun. \n\nThe player is carrying a phaser. Understand &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Five&quot;, and &quot;shiny&quot; as the phaser.\n\n[Error: will not compile!]\nInstead of setting the phaser to &quot;kill&quot;:\n\tnow the phaser is set to kill;\n\tsay &quot;You set your phaser to kill.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A phaser is a kind of thing. </div>
<div class="codeline">A phaser can be either set to stun or set to kill. </div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining the phaser, say "Your shiny Mark Five phaser. Dual setting - stun and kill. [if the phaser is set to kill]It is currently set to kill.[Otherwise]It is currently set to stun." </div>
<div class="codeline">A phaser is usually set to stun. </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player is carrying a phaser. Understand "Mark", "Five", and "shiny" as the phaser.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">[Error: will not compile!]</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of setting the phaser to "kill":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the phaser is set to kill;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You set your phaser to kill."</div>
</div>

<p>The problem is that the Instead rule is attempting to change the
setting not of any individual phaser but of the entire <em>kind.</em>
Inform won’t let the author do that. There are a couple of ways to solve
the problem. We can rewrite the Instead rule so that Inform knows which
phaser to set:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of setting a phaser (called P) to &quot;kill&quot;:\n\tnow P is set to kill;\n\tsay &quot;You set your phaser to kill.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of setting a phaser (called P) to "kill":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now P is set to kill;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You set your phaser to kill."</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s another way to do exactly the same thing without using the
“called” phrase to create a temporary name for the object:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of setting a phaser to &quot;kill&quot;:\n\tnow the noun is set to kill;\n\tsay &quot;You set your phaser to kill.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of setting a phaser to "kill":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the noun is set to kill;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You set your phaser to kill."</div>
</div>

<p>Both Instead rules for the phaser will work. Either way, Inform now
understands that it’s supposed to set one particular phaser to kill, and
it’s happy to do so. In general, though, creating a kind and then an
object that has the same name as the kind is best avoided. Sometimes
it’s necessary; for instance, the door kind is built into Inform, and it
would be silly to try to avoid calling a door a door. But if you can
come up with a specific word for your new kinds, a word that is not used
by any of the objects, you’ll create fewer confusing bugs.</p>

<p>Unless you’re planning to have several phasers in your game, there’s
no reason to make phaser a kind in the first place. Instead, make it a
plain old thing. The first sentence in the code below does exactly
that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a phaser. The phaser can be set to kill or set to stun. The phaser is set to stun. The description is &quot;Your shiny Mark Five phaser. Dual setting - stun and kill. [if the phaser is set to kill]It is currently set to kill.[Otherwise]It is currently set to stun.&quot; Understand &quot;Mark&quot;, &quot;Five&quot;, and &quot;shiny&quot; as the phaser.\n\nInstead of setting the phaser to &quot;kill&quot;:\n\tnow the phaser is set to kill;\n\tsay &quot;You set your phaser to kill.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a phaser. The phaser can be set to kill or set to stun. The phaser is set to stun. The description is "Your shiny Mark Five phaser. Dual setting - stun and kill. [if the phaser is set to kill]It is currently set to kill.[Otherwise]It is currently set to stun." Understand "Mark", "Five", and "shiny" as the phaser.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of setting the phaser to "kill":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the phaser is set to kill;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You set your phaser to kill."</div>
</div>

<p>Now the Instead rule for setting the phaser works the way the
original author of this code intended.</p>

<p>One reason for the confusion here, by the way, is that Inform quite
often ignores “a” and “the” when compiling. There are a few situations
where it notices “a” or “the”, such as when constructing lists, but in
this particular case it pays no attention whatever to the difference
that native English speakers would see between “a phaser” and “the
phaser”.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="noun-and-second-noun">
<h4>Noun &amp; Second Noun</h4>

<p>Notice the term “the noun” in the code above. The words “noun” and
“second noun” have a special meaning in Inform. The noun is a temporary
value (a variable) that refers to whatever object the player mentioned
in the most recent command.</p>

<p>For instance, if the player types EAT THE PIE,” the pie object
becomes (temporarily) “the noun.” Likewise, the second noun is the
second object in a two-object command, such as STAB TROLL WITH SWORD.
Here, the troll is the noun and the sword is the second noun. You should
always use “noun” and “second noun” in code (though without quotation
marks, of course) when you’re not sure what object the player will be
referring to. (See <a
href="#Ref_variable">Variables</a> for more.)</p>
</div>

<h3 id="the-names-of-things-1">The Names of Things</h3>

<p>When creating objects, it’s a good idea to add an adjective to the
name. When possible, the adjective should be unique, not a word that can
also be used with other objects. This is not required, but failing to do
it can get you into trouble. Here’s a simple example that shows why:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The red potion vial is an open container on the table.\n\nThe red potion is in the red potion vial. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The red potion vial is an open container on the table.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The red potion is in the red potion vial. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>This code won’t compile. The compiler complains, “You wrote 'The red
potion is in the red potion vial': but this asks to put something inside
itself, like saying 'the bottle is in the bottle'.” The compiler gets
confused because all of the words that can refer to the red potion can
also apply to the vial. The solution is simple: Just give the vial and
potion their own names:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The red vial is an open container on the table.\n\nThe healing potion is in the red vial.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The red vial is an open container on the table.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The healing potion is in the red vial.</div>
</div>

<p>In a real game, we’d need to write more code than this. For one
thing, the way this has been written, the player could pick up the
potion, which would be silly because the potion is probably be a liquid.
Inform doesn’t know that a thing is a liquid unless you do some extra
work. If you’re curious about liquid handling, you can consult <a href="../RB_10.html#section_2">RB 10.2: Liquids</a>. (Liquids, ropes, and
fire are among the more awkward concepts to implement in interactive
fiction. For now, though, we’re just talking about giving things
distinctive names.)</p>

<p>Here’s a more complicated version of the same problem. Let’s suppose
you’ve created three keys in your game &ndash; a rusty key, a silver key, and
a third object called simply the key. Inform will let you do this, as
long as you define the plain old key (not an object called “the plain
old key” but the key with no adjectives) first in your source code.
During the course of the game, the player might be carrying all three of
the keys, and might need to unlock a door using the one that you’ve
called simply “key”. This will cause a bug to appear in your game. The
output will look like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>unlock door with key</div>

<p>Which key do you mean, the rusty key, the silver key, or the key?</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>key</div>

<p>Which key do you mean, the rusty key, the silver key, or the key?</p>
</div>

<p>The question above goes by the fancy term <em>disambiguation</em>.
The parser is attempting to figure out what the player’s input means. It
comes up with two or more possible meanings, and has no way to decide
which is correct, because the input is ambiguous &ndash; the parser doesn’t
know which key object the player is referring to. The command UNLOCK
DOOR WITH KEY could mean several different things, so the parser needs
to ask the player to provide more information. The parser tries to get
rid of the ambiguity by asking the player to add some detail.</p>

<p>As long as the player wants to use the silver key or the rusty key,
this is not a problem: The parser’s question can be answered SILVER or
RUSTY and the game will proceed as planned. But if the player needs to
use the plain key, the one for which there’s no adjective, the player is
stuck: There’s no way to tell the parser that you mean the plain old
key, other than by going into a different room, entering the commands
DROP SILVER KEY and DROP RUSTY KEY, and then returning to the room with
the locked door. To avoid giving your players headaches, be sure to give
each key its own adjective when naming it.</p>

<p>Inform is very unusual among programming languages, by the way, in
allowing you to name objects using spaces between words. Most
programming languages would require that the various key objects above
be named silver_key and rusty_key (using the underscore character),
silverKey and rustyKey, or with some other combination of letters. The
text name (what the player reads while playing the game) would be a
separate piece of data. But in Inform, when you call something the
silver key in your source code, you’re creating both a code name (silver
key) and a name for output text purposes (“silver key”). There are times
  when the two types of names need to be separate; you’ll learn how to set that up in <a
href="#Ref_privately-named">Phrasing and Punctuation</a> in Chapter 9.</p>

<h3 id="long-names">Long Names</h3>

<p>Normally, Inform looks only at the first nine letters in each word.
The rest of the letters are ignored. This is true both for the names of
things in your code and for the words in commands that the player types.
Normally nine letters are plenty. (In the very first text-based games,
only the first five or six letters in the player’s commands were read,
and six letters weren’t really enough.) But as <a href="../WI_3.html#section_1">WI 3.1 Descriptions</a> points out, if you happen to put a
superhero and a superheroine in the same room, the player will quite
likely get the wrong result from the command KISS SUPERHEROINE.</p>

<p>In fact, the confusion can get deeper than that &ndash; unlikely, but
possible. Let’s suppose that for some bizarre reason you’ve created the
following four objects:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a superheroism, a superheroine, a superheroich, and a superheroidiot.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a superheroism, a superheroine, a superheroich, and a superheroidiot.</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s the result when the player tries to take inventory:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span><strong>i</strong></div>

<p>You are carrying:</p>

<p>four</p>
</div>

<p>Inform has created four indistinguishable objects, because it was
only looking at the first nine letters.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get around this problem, if you ever need to.
The easy way requires compiling to Glulx. If you’re not already
compiling your game to Glulx, go to the Settings page in the Inform IDE
and click the Glulx button. Then add the following line near the top of
your source:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use DICT_WORD_SIZE of 12.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use DICT_WORD_SIZE of 12.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player will be able to use both SUPERHERO and SUPERHEROINE in
commands, and Inform will be able to tell the difference. You can use as
large a number as you’d like, but if your game is written in English,
it’s hard to see how you would ever need more than the first 12 letters
of each word.</p>

<p>If you need to compile to the Z-machine standard (possibly because
you want your game to be playable on handheld devices), you won’t be
able to change the value of DICT_WORD_SIZE, so you’ll need to resort to
a little trickery. The next example is a stripped-down version of some
code I used in my game “A Flustered Duck.” Some leprechauns are having a
picnic in a meadow, and there’s also a single leprechaun (with whom the
player can converse) wandering around playing a fiddle. The trick is,
we’re going to use words shorter than nine letters, but allow both the
player’s input and the game’s output to use the longer words.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command: \n\tlet N be text; \n\tlet N be the player&apos;s command; \n\treplace the regular expression &quot;leprec&quot; in N with &quot;lpc&quot;;\n\tchange the text of the player&apos;s command to N.\n\nThe Grassy Knoll is a room. &quot;Some leprechauns are having a picnic here. One leprechaun is sauntering around playing a sprightly tune on a fiddle.&quot;\n\nSome lpchauns are scenery in the Grassy Knoll. The description is &quot;They&apos;re enjoying their picnic.&quot; The printed name of the lpchauns is &quot;leprechauns&quot;.\n\nThe lpchaun is a man in the Grassy Knoll. The description is &quot;He&apos;s playing a fiddle.&quot; The printed name of the lpchaun is &quot;leprechaun&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be text; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be the player's command; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "leprec" in N with "lpc";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;change the text of the player's command to N.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Grassy Knoll is a room. "Some leprechauns are having a picnic here. One leprechaun is sauntering around playing a sprightly tune on a fiddle."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Some lpchauns are scenery in the Grassy Knoll. The description is "They're enjoying their picnic." The printed name of the lpchauns is "leprechauns".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The lpchaun is a man in the Grassy Knoll. The description is "He's playing a fiddle." The printed name of the lpchaun is "leprechaun".</div>
</div>

<p>The first block of code strips a few letters out of the player’s
commands. If the player types X LEPRECHAUN, the game will see the
command as X LPCHAUN. Then we use Inform’s handy printed name property
so that the object whose real name is lpchaun will be displayed as
“leprechaun”, and similarly for the lpchauns.</p>

<h3 id="initial-appearance">Initial Appearance</h3>

<p>When you create a new object and put it in a room, it will be
mentioned right after the room description, but in a very basic way. If
we’ve created a banjo, for instance, the room description will end with
a paragraph that reads, “You can see a banjo here.”</p>

<p>Inform objects have a special property called <strong>initial
appearance</strong>. If an object has an initial appearance, this will
be used in the room description until the object has been picked up by
the player.</p>

<p>If Inform sees a quoted sentence just after a new object has been
created, it will know that this is the initial appearance of the object.
We could create our banjo like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Meadow is a room. &quot;Wildflowers carpet the meadow.&quot;\n\nThe old banjo is in the Meadow. &quot;A banjo lies forgotten among the wildflowers.&quot; The description is &quot;It&apos;s a 1938 Selmer 5-string.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Meadow is a room. "Wildflowers carpet the meadow."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The old banjo is in the Meadow. "A banjo lies forgotten among the wildflowers." The description is "It's a 1938 Selmer 5-string."</div>
</div>

<p>The sentence “A banjo lies forgotten among the wildflowers” is the
initial appearance of the banjo. The term “initial appearance” is
actually the name of a <strong>property</strong> that objects can have
in Inform. Properties are a type of data that’s attached to an object.
The description of an object is another of its properties, and the
printed name (shown earlier in the example that involved leprechauns) is
yet another.</p>

<p>When we give the banjo an initial appearance, this is what will
happen when the player enters the Meadow:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Meadow</p>

<p>Wildflowers carpet the meadow.</p>

<p>A banjo lies forgotten among the wildflowers.</p>
</div>

<p>Having the line about the banjo off in a paragraph by itself looks a
little odd, but that’s mainly because the room description of the meadow
is so brief. If the room description were three lines long, having a new
paragraph about the banjo would look perfectly natural.</p>

<p>An initial appearance will be used only until an object is picked up
for the first time by the player character. There may be times when
you’d like an object to be referred to in a non-default way in room
descriptions on an ongoing basis, or possibly in several non-default
ways depending on which room it’s in. The following code does that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for writing a paragraph about the shovel:\n\tsay &quot;[if the shovel is in the Garage]Your shovel lies in the corner against the wall.[otherwise if the shovel is in the Tool Shed]On a shelf is your handy shovel.[otherwise if the shovel is in the Work Site]Your shovel is stuck in the ground here.[otherwise]You seem to have left the shovel lying here.[end if]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  <div class="codeline">Rule for writing a paragraph about the shovel:</div>

</div>

<h3 id="adding-vocabulary-words-with-understand">Adding Vocabulary Words with “Understand”</h3>

<p>When you create an object, such as the paintbrush we created earlier
in this chapter, Inform is smart enough to understand two things at
once. First: you, the author, can refer to the object in your code as a
paintbrush, and the compiler will know what you mean. Second: the player
who is playing your game can also call it a paintbrush, and the parser
will know what the player means.</p>

<p>When you first start learning Inform, these two facts may seem to be
almost the same &ndash; the object is a paintbrush, and that’s what it’s
called. What could be complicated about that? But in reality, the name
of an object for internal purposes (that is, when you’re writing code)
is not at all the same thing as the word(s) the player can use to refer
to the object or the words that are printed out by Inform as the story
unfolds for the player. They’re often the same, but they don’t have to
be. In fact, Inform allows you to make them completely different if you
need to. (See the section on “The Names of Things” in Chapter 8 of the
<em>Handbook</em>.)</p>

<p>After creating an object, you’ll almost always want to add extra
vocabulary words to it &ndash; words that the player can use to refer to it.
With a paintbrush, for instance, the player will quite often want to
call it a brush. But the parser won’t understand that word unless you
tell it to:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The paintbrush is in the Tool Shed.\nUnderstand &quot;brush&quot; as the paintbrush.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  <div class="codeline">The paintbrush is in the Tool Shed.</div>
    <div class="codeline">Understand "brush" as the paintbrush.</div>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve added the second sentence, the player can use the word
“brush” to refer to the paintbrush &ndash; but the author can’t. This is a key
concept: The author can only refer to an object using the actual word or
words that are used in the sentence that creates the object.</p>

<p>When you write a description for a new object, you’ll quite often
find that you’re adding extra adjectives. These should always be added
as vocabulary:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The paintbrush is in the Tool Shed. The description is “The bristles of the paintbrush are stiff with dried paint.” Understand &quot;brush&quot;, &quot;bristles&quot;, &quot;stiff&quot;, &quot;dried&quot;, and &quot;paint&quot; as the paintbrush.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The paintbrush is in the Tool Shed. The description is “The bristles of the paintbrush are stiff with dried paint.” Understand "brush", "bristles", "stiff", "dried", and "paint" as the paintbrush.</div>
</div>

<p>If you also have a can of paint in your game (which wouldn’t be
surprising if you’ve created a paintbrush), the word “paint” will end up
being ambiguous. It will be able to refer either to the brush or to the
paint can (and possibly to the paint <em>in</em> the can as well), and
also to the command PAINT. Handling all of the possibilities in a case
like this can get a little tricky. We’re not going to go through the
whole troubleshooting process here, but it’s certainly something to be
aware of when you start creating objects whose names and vocabulary
words overlap.</p>

<p>Inform will attempt to keep track of what you mean when writing the
game, and the parser will try to figure out what the player means when
entering the word PAINT. If the parser can’t figure out what the player
meant, it will ask questions. You can help the parser by writing “does
the player mean” rules (see <a href="../WI_17.html#section_19">WI 17.19 Does the player mean&hellip;</a>).</p>

<h4 id="conditional-vocabulary">Conditional Vocabulary</h4>

<p>Most of the objects in a game will likely have the same vocabulary
words from one end of the game to the other. But there are situations in
which you may want to switch certain words on or off. For instance, if
the vase gets broken during the game, the player should be able to refer
to it as BROKEN VASE &ndash; but not otherwise.</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is to refer to properties of the object
when listing the vocabulary words:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The porcelain vase is in the Museum Lobby. The vase can be broken or unbroken. Understand &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;shattered&quot; as the vase when the vase is broken.\n\nInstead of attacking the vase:\n\tnow the vase is broken;\n\tnow the printed name of the vase is &quot;broken porcelain vase&quot;;\n\tsay &quot;You shatter the vase.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The porcelain vase is in the Museum Lobby. The vase can be broken or unbroken. Understand "broken" and "shattered" as the vase when the vase is broken.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of attacking the vase:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the vase is broken;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the printed name of the vase is "broken porcelain vase";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You shatter the vase."</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that the Instead rule both changes the broken/unbroken
property of the vase and changes the vase’s printed name.</p>

<p>For more complex story situations, you may want to create scenes (as
described in Chapter 8 of the <em>Handbook</em>) and make the vocabulary
words that the player is allowed to use depend on whether a scene is
happening:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Daytime is a recurring scene. Daytime begins when the sun is part of the sky. Daytime ends when the sun is not part of the sky.\n\nUnderstand &quot;twittering&quot; and &quot;chirping&quot; as the birds when daytime is happening.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Daytime is a recurring scene. Daytime begins when the sun is part of the sky. Daytime ends when the sun is not part of the sky.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "twittering" and "chirping" as the birds when daytime is happening.</div>
</div>

<p>For more on giving objects sets of words (like broken and unbroken)
as properties, see the section on “Word Properties” later in this
chapter.</p>

<h3 id="containers-supporters">Containers &amp; Supporters</h3>

<p>Every object in your model world (except backdrops and doors, which
operate in a slightly different way) is either in a room, or it’s
off-stage. If an object is off-stage, it’s nowhere, at least at the
moment. But even when something is off-stage, it’s still part of the
game, and could be moved into play later on. (See the section “Moving
Things Around,” below, to learn how to do this.) The question of where
things are located is rather interesting, as we’ll discover in the
section “Testing Where a Thing Is.” Before we dig into that question, we
need to introduce two new kinds: containers and supporters. These were
introduced briefly at the end of Chapter 2, in the section “Room
Descriptions.” Now it’s time to take a closer look.</p>

<p>A container is, as you can probably guess, an object that can contain
other things. That is, the player can put things <em>in</em> a
container. Most of the time, if you need a basket or a cupboard in your
game, you’d make the basket or cupboard a container.</p>

<p>A supporter is like a table: it’s an object that you can put things
<em>on</em>. Inform understands the difference between a supporter and a
container. If the player tries to put something <em>in</em> a table,
she’ll be told, “That can’t contain things.” If she tries to put
something <em>on</em> a container, such as a cupboard, she’ll be told,
“Putting things on the cupboard would achieve nothing.”</p>

<p>By default, a supporter is assumed to be a piece of furniture: It’s
not scenery (unless you make it scenery), but it’s fixed in place. If
you want to create a portable supporter, such as a tea tray, you need to
tell Inform that it is not fixed in place:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The tea tray is a supporter on the buffet. The tea tray is not fixed in place.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The tea tray is a supporter on the buffet. The tea tray is not fixed in place.</div>
</div>

<p>If the player happens to be carrying the tea tray at the beginning of
the game, Inform will guess correctly that even though it’s a supporter,
it’s not fixed in place. But if it’s not initially carried, you have to
explicitly say that it’s not fixed in place.</p>

<p>There are ways to create an object (such as a chest of drawers) that
the player can put things either in or on; see the section “Objects that
Have Parts,” later in this chapter. Such an object can behave like a
supporter in response to some player commands, and behave like a
container at other times. For the rest of the discussion in the section
you’re reading now, though, we’re going to assume that containers and
supporters are entirely different. The main thing they have in common is
that the player can put movable things on or in them.</p>

<p>Containers have some special properties that are not available for
supporters. A container can be <strong>openable</strong>. If you create
a container but don’t tell Inform that it’s openable, Inform will assume
that it’s permanently open &ndash; that it operates pretty much like a basket.
On the other hand, if you tell Inform that your cupboard is openable,
then the commands OPEN CUPBOARD and CLOSE CUPBOARD will work just the
way the player would expect them to (though the cupboard won’t have an
actual door &ndash; you can give it a door, but that’s a more complex coding
challenge; for details, see “Objects that Have Parts,” later in this
chapter).</p>

<p>Your game will automatically keep track of whether each container is
opened or closed. If it’s closed, the player won’t be able to see or
take anything that’s inside. On the other hand, if the container is not
only openable but <strong>transparent</strong>, the player will be able
to see what’s inside even when the container is closed, but won’t be
able to take what’s inside. The transparent property is good for
creating things like bird cages and glass-front sideboards.</p>

<p>A container that is openable can start the game either
<strong>open</strong> or <strong>closed</strong>. Inform understands
that “not open” means the same thing as “closed.” So we could create a
basic cupboard like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The cupboard is a closed openable container in the Kitchen.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The cupboard is a closed openable container in the Kitchen.</div>
</div>

<p>If a container is openable, it can also be lockable. If it’s
lockable, it can start the game either locked or unlocked. And as <a href="../WI_3.html#section_13">WI 3.13 Locks and keys</a> explains, things that are lockable can be given keys.</p>

<p>In fact, Inform is a little pickier than this: by default, you can
only say that something is lockable if it’s a container or a door. If
you want to create a small gold locket as a piece of jewelry, and give
it a key, one easy way to do it would be to make it a container &ndash; after
which you’ll probably want to write an Instead rule to prevent the
player from putting anything at all into it (unless putting a small
photograph or a magic bean into the locket is the solution to a puzzle).
This is not difficult to do:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a small gold locket. The locket is an openable container. The locket is lockable and locked. The tiny gold key unlocks the locket.\n\nThe player carries a bowling ball and the tiny gold key.\n\nInstead of inserting something into the small gold locket:\n\tif the locket is closed:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;d need to open the locket to do that.&quot;;\n\totherwise if the player does not carry the noun:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;re not holding [the noun].&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;There&apos;s not room for [the noun] in the locket.&quot;\n\nTest me with &quot;put ball in locket / unlock locket with key / open locket / put ball in locket&quot;. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a small gold locket. The locket is an openable container. The locket is lockable and locked. The tiny gold key unlocks the locket.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries a bowling ball and the tiny gold key.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of inserting something into the small gold locket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the locket is closed:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd need to open the locket to do that.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if the player does not carry the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You're not holding [the noun].";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There's not room for [the noun] in the locket."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with "put ball in locket / unlock locket with key / open locket / put ball in locket". </div>
</div>

<p>Note the use of “inserting something into” in the code above. One of
the common mistakes authors make is trying to write a rule for “putting
something in” something else. Inform lets the player use the syntax PUT
BOWLING BALL IN LOCKET, but the action that this produces is inserting
it into, not putting it in.</p>

<p>But there’s an easier way. By adding a little more code, we can make
the locket lockable and openable even though it’s not a container. The
reasons why this type of code works the way it does are a bit technical.
What you need to know is that before you make something openable or
lockable (unless it’s a container or a door), you have to tell Inform
that it <em>can be</em> openable or lockable. Here’s how:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a locket. The locket can be lockable. The locket is lockable. The locket can be openable. The locket is openable. The locket can be open. The locket can be locked. The locket is not open. The locket is locked.\n\nThe player carries the tiny gold key. The tiny gold key unlocks the locket.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a locket. The locket can be lockable. The locket is lockable. The locket can be openable. The locket is openable. The locket can be open. The locket can be locked. The locket is not open. The locket is locked.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries the tiny gold key. The tiny gold key unlocks the locket.</div>
</div>

<p>If you do this, you’ll find that the locket can be opened and closed,
locked and unlocked &ndash; but it can’t contain things, because it isn’t a
container. The code above doesn’t include a description of the locket
(which should probably change depending on whether it is open or
closed). Nor does the code tell the player what will be discovered upon
opening the locket, which would presumably be important information.</p>

<p>We were talking, a couple of pages back, about a kitchen cupboard.
Let’s make the cupboard a little fancier:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The glass-front cupboard is an openable transparent lockable container in the Kitchen. The cupboard is closed and locked. The brass key unlocks the cupboard.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The glass-front cupboard is an openable transparent lockable container in the Kitchen. The cupboard is closed and locked. The brass key unlocks the cupboard.</div>
</div>

<p>In order to allow the player to UNLOCK THE CUPBOARD DOOR, we might
want to give the cupboard an actual glass door. To do that, see <a href="#objects-that-have-parts">Objects
that Have Parts</a>.
Another way would be to make the word “door” a synonym for the
cupboard.</p>

<p>Inform assumes that the cupboard is <em>permanently</em> openable,
and that it can be opened or closed during the course of the game. But
your code can change a container to not openable during the course of
the game. This is something you will rarely need to do, but someday you
might want to create an openable lockable container that is closed and
locked, and that has <em>no</em> key. If the solution of the puzzle is
HIT CUPBOARD WITH HAMMER, you might create a new action called attacking
it with and then write some code along these lines:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Carry out attacking the cupboard with the hammer:\n\tnow the cupboard is open;\n\tnow the cupboard is not openable;\n\tnow the cupboard is unlocked;\n\tnow the cupboard is not lockable;\n\tsay &quot;You smash the cupboard door with the hammer, and it springs open.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Carry out attacking the cupboard with the hammer:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the cupboard is open;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the cupboard is not openable;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the cupboard is unlocked;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the cupboard is not lockable;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You smash the cupboard door with the hammer, and it springs open."</div>
</div>

<p>Once this cupboard has been smashed, it’s no longer lockable and no
longer openable.</p>

<p>Inform has a standard way of describing containers and supporters and
their contents, but we can change this if we need to. To look at what
usually happens (unless we write some new code), let’s create a simple
game that has three containers and a supporter. One of the containers
(the cupboard) and the supporter (the table) are scenery. Another
container, the suitcase, is closed and openable. The final container, a
basket, is not scenery and not openable. That is, the basket is
permanently open. Here’s the code for the game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Living Room is a room. &quot;Your standard American living room, equipped with a table and a cupboard.&quot;\n\nThe table is a scenery supporter in the Living Room.\n\nThe cupboard is a closed openable scenery container in the Living Room.\n\nThe basket is a container in the Living Room.\n\nThe suitcase is a closed openable container in the Living Room.\n\nThe pear is on the table. The apple is in the cupboard. The plum is in the basket. The carrot is in the suitcase. The player carries a banana. \n\nTest me with &quot;open suitcase / look / take carrot / look / open cupboard / look / take plum / look / take pear / look&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Living Room is a room. "Your standard American living room, equipped with a table and a cupboard."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The table is a scenery supporter in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The cupboard is a closed openable scenery container in the Living Room.</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with "open suitcase / look / take carrot / look / open cupboard / look / take plum / look / take pear / look"</div>
</div>

<p>If you haven’t used the TEST ME command, this would be a good time to
try it out. Create a new, empty project, paste the code shown above into
it, and click the Go! button. When the game appears in the right-hand
page, enter the command TEST ME. Inform will run through all of the
commands in the “Test me with” line, above. Here’s the output:</p>

<div class="game-output">

<p>This output shows several things about how Inform handles containers
and supporters. Sometimes the game will add sentences of its own after
the room description that you wrote; other times, it won’t add anything.
Here are the normal rules (which we can change if we need to):</p>

<ol class="num">
<li>
If a container is scenery, it doesn’t get its own paragraph of output
after the room description &ndash; not even when it’s open and something is
visible inside. If the player wants to see what’s in a scenery
container, she has to LOOK IN it or SEARCH it. (These two commands lead
to the same action.)</li>
<li>If a supporter is scenery (as the table is in this game), it gets a
separate paragraph after the room description, but only if something is
on it. When nothing is on it (after we TAKE PEAR in this game) the table
no longer rates a paragraph of its own. Inform assumes that things
sitting on supporters are more immediately visible than things in open
containers. But if nothing is on the scenery supporter, Inform assumes
that it has already been mentioned in the room description, and adds
nothing.</li>
<li>If a container is not scenery, Inform will normally add a paragraph
about it after the room description (assuming it’s in the room &ndash; not if
the player is holding it). If the container is openable and closed,
Inform will add “(closed)” after mentioning it. If it’s open and
contains something, Inform will list the contents. If it’s open and
empty, Inform will say “(empty)”.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="stealthy-containers">Stealthy Containers</h4>

<p>The logic shown above is fine as a basic way of designing a game, but
you may run into situations in which it doesn’t work well. For instance,
you might want it to be less than obvious that a closed openable
container is actually a container at all. Getting rid of the “(closed)”
text would solve that. Here’s how:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for printing room description details of a closed container:\n\tstop.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing room description details of a closed container:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop.</div>
</div>

<p>Once the closed container is picked up by the player, however, the
“(closed)” will reappear when the player takes inventory. To prevent
that, we need another few lines:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for printing the name of a closed container (called C) while taking inventory:\n\tsay &quot;[printed name of C]&quot;;\n\tomit contents in listing.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of a closed container (called C) while taking inventory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[printed name of C]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;omit contents in listing.</div>
</div>

<p>The initial appearance property can also help get us get specific
printouts for containers, as can the printing a paragraph about
activity. Let’s look at a more complete example. We have a hollow log
(an open container) in which is a gold key. We don’t want to make the
log scenery, because the player needs to be able to pick it up and take
it to the river in order to cross the river.</p>

<p>Our first thought might be to write it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest is a room. &quot;Tall old trees stand on all sides.&quot;\n\nThe hollow log is in the Forest.\n\nThe gold key is in the hollow log.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest is a room. "Tall old trees stand on all sides."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hollow log is in the Forest.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The gold key is in the hollow log.</div>
</div>

<p>If we tell Inform that the key is in the log, we don’t even have to
mention that the log is an open container; Inform will figure that out.
(For that matter, if we say that Steve is wearing a hat, Inform will
figure out that Steve is a person without our needing to say so, because
only people can wear things; and also that the hat is wearable.) But
when we compile this code, we’ll find that the key is in plain sight, so
the puzzle will fall flat. Here’s the output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Forest</p>

<p>Tall old trees stand on all sides.</p>

<p>You can see a hollow log (in which is a gold key) here.</p>
</div>

<p>One way to get rid of the mention of the key is to create an initial
appearance for the hollow log, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest is a room. &quot;Tall old trees stand on all sides.&quot;\n\nThe hollow log is in the Forest. &quot;A hollow log lies fallen next to the path.&quot;\n\nThe gold key is in the hollow log.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest is a room. "Tall old trees stand on all sides."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hollow log is in the Forest. "A hollow log lies fallen next to the path."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The gold key is in the hollow log.</div>
</div>

<p>The new sentence, “A hollow log lies fallen next to the path,” is
<em>not</em> the description of the log. (We haven’t written a
description yet.) It’s the log’s initial appearance. As explained
earlier in this chapter, in the section “Initial Appearance,” Inform
will use the initial appearance we’ve given to the log instead of
writing its own paragraph about the log. But it will only use the
initial appearance until the log has been picked up. If the player picks
up the log and drops it again, Inform will toss out the initial
appearance and go back to its standard way of mentioning the log, thus
revealing the gold key to the player.</p>

<p>A slightly better solution is to give Inform a new rule for writing a
paragraph about the hollow log. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for writing a paragraph about the hollow log:\n\tsay &quot;[if the location is the Forest]A hollow log lies fallen next to the path[otherwise]A hollow log is lying here[end if].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for writing a paragraph about the hollow log:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[if the location is the Forest]A hollow log lies fallen next to the path[otherwise]A hollow log is lying here[end if]."</div>
</div>

<p>When we’ve written a “rule for writing a paragraph about”, Inform
will <em>always</em> use this rule when adding the log to a room
description rather than construct its own sentence about the log, so the
gold key will remain hidden until the player actually thinks to search
the log. (Of course, the key might fall out when the player picks up the
log. That’s a more complex situation, which I’ll leave you to work out
for yourself. Hint: Try writing an After rule, and include the phrase
“for the first time”.)</p>

<p>The downside of writing a new “rule for writing a paragraph about” is
that if we <em>do</em> want the contents of the hollow log to be
mentioned at some point in the game, we’ll have to write a more complex
rule that will tell Inform when we do or don’t want this extra output,
and how the extra text should be put together.</p>

<p>We’re not quite out of the woods yet, though (so to speak). Remember,
we didn’t make our hollow log scenery, because we want the player to be
able to pick it up and move it to another location. While carrying it,
the player might think to take inventory. Here’s the result:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>i</div>

<p>You are carrying:</p>

<p>a hollow log</p>

<p>a gold key</p>
</div>

<p>Oops &ndash; the gold key has been revealed again. This happens because the
contents of open containers and supporters that the player is carrying
are listed when an inventory list is constructed. To prevent this, we
need to add another new rule. This is like the one mentioned a couple of
pages back, but here we’ll apply it specifically to the hollow log
rather than to all closed containers (because, of course, the hollow log
isn’t closed; it’s just behaving in a mysterious way because it’s a
puzzle):</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for printing the name of the hollow log while taking inventory:\n\tsay &quot;hollow log&quot;;\n\tomit contents in listing.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of the hollow log while taking inventory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "hollow log";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;omit contents in listing.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes we may want an open container to list its contents. We just
don’t want Inform to print out an annoying reminder that the container
is closed or empty every time it includes the container in a list. <a href="../WI_18.html#section_10">WI 18.10 Printing
the name of something</a> shows how to handle this. Adapting the code
there slightly, we’ll create a pillbox. While we’re at it, we’ll
restrict the pillbox so that it can only contain pills. This type of
restriction is often useful with small containers. (Another way to
prevent the player from putting a bowling ball into the pillbox would be
to use the extension called <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Bulk%20Limiter-v9.i7x">Bulk Limiter by Eric Eve</a>.)</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>Notice the line above that says “(containing [a list of things in the
pillbox])”. This is a handy bit of syntax; Inform can construct lists
during the game if we include code that explains, in a general way, what
should be included in the list. Incidentally, this is one of the
situations where the compiler will notice the difference between “a” and
“the”. If we say “[a list of things&hellip;]”, the list will be printed out
in the game as “a blue pill, a red pill, and a yellow pill”. But if we
say “[the list of things&hellip;]”, the list will appear as “the blue pill,
the red pill, and the yellow pill”.</p>

<p>Earlier, when we were writing code for the hollow log, we were trying
to prevent it from revealing its contents. But sometimes we have to help
Inform go the other direction. The contents of open containers will be
listed when the container is mentioned in a list that Inform prints out
&ndash; but the contents won’t be mentioned when an open container is simply
EXAMINEd. If an open container is examined, the game won’t bother to
list what’s inside. The player needs to LOOK IN or SEARCH the container
to learn what’s in it. With an ordinary container like a suitcase,
forcing the player to take that extra step is a bit silly. So here’s a
suitcase that will list its contents (and its state) when examined:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The suitcase is in the Train Station. The suitcase is a closed openable container. The description is &quot;A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise] It&apos;s closed.[end if]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The suitcase is in the Train Station. The suitcase is a closed openable container. The description is "A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise] It's closed.[end if]".</div>
</div>

<p>That works pretty well, as long as there’s something in the suitcase.
But if the suitcase is empty, we get the following output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x suitcase</div>

<p>A vintage item of brown leather luggage. In the suitcase you can see
nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>That “you can see nothing” is a bit crude. I’d rather have the game
say “The suitcase seems to be empty.” The difficulty is this: Inform
won’t let us embed one if-test inside of another in a double-quoted
string. We’re not allowed to do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if there is something in the suitcase][if open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise] It&apos;s closed.[end if][otherwise] It seems to be empty.[end if]&quot;. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if there is something in the suitcase][if open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise] It's closed.[end if][otherwise] It seems to be empty.[end if]". [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>The error report from the compiler is helpful. It says this: “a
second '[if &hellip;]' text substitution occurs inside an existing one, which
makes this text too complicated. While a single text can contain more
than one '[if &hellip;]', this can only happen if the old if is finished with
an '[end if]' or the new one is written '[otherwise if]'. If you need
more complicated variety than this allows, the best approach is to
define a new text substitution of your own ('To say fiddly details:
&hellip;') and then use it in this text by including the '[fiddly details]'.”
This tells us exactly how to write code that will do what we want.
Here’s one way to do it, using an [otherwise if] construction:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if there is something in the suitcase and the suitcase is open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise if open] It seems to be empty.[otherwise] It&apos;s closed.[end if]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "A vintage item of brown leather luggage.[if there is something in the suitcase and the suitcase is open] In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase].[otherwise if open] It seems to be empty.[otherwise] It's closed.[end if]".</div>
</div>

<p>And here’s another way, using Inform’s handy To Say phrase:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The suitcase is a closed openable container. The description is &quot;A vintage item of brown leather luggage. [suitcase-desc details].&quot;\n\nTo say suitcase-desc details:\n\tif the suitcase is open:\n\t\tif the number of entries in the list of things inside the suitcase is at least 1:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase]&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;It seems to be empty&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;It&apos;s closed&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The suitcase is a closed openable container. The description is "A vintage item of brown leather luggage. [suitcase-desc details]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say suitcase-desc details:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the suitcase is open:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of entries in the list of things inside the suitcase is at least 1:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "In the suitcase you can see [a list of things inside the suitcase]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It seems to be empty";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It's closed".</div>
</div>

<p>Pay close attention to the way the periods at the ends of the
sentences are handled. We want the game to print out exactly one blank
line after the description of the suitcase, so we put the period just
before the closing quote in the <em>main</em> description, not in the
sentences in the suitcase-desc details. Notice also the space before “
[suitcase-desc details]”. This ensures that there will be a space
between sentences, no matter which details are printed out.</p>


<p>The same thing happens if the
player examines a table &ndash; Inform won’t bother to mention what’s on the
table unless we tell it we want that information to be included in the
description. With a table, though, printing the line “It seems to be
empty” in response to an EXAMINE action would be a bit silly, so the
code can be simpler:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The billiard table is a scenery supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is &quot;The table is big and green[if there is something on the table]. On the table you can see [a list of things on the table][end if].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The billiard table is a scenery supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is "The table is big and green[if there is something on the table]. On the table you can see [a list of things on the table][end if]."</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s another way to accomplish the same thing. This one moves the
question of whether there’s something on the table into a different
block of code.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The billiard table is a scenery supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is &quot;The table is big and green[list-table-stuff].&quot;\n\nTo say list-table-stuff:\n\tlet L be the list of things on the billiard table;\n\tif the number of entries in L &gt; 0:\n\t\tsay &quot;. On the table you can see [a list of things on the billiard table]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The billiard table is a scenery supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is "The table is big and green[list-table-stuff]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say list-table-stuff:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be the list of things on the billiard table;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of entries in L &gt; 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say ". On the table you can see [a list of things on the billiard table]".</div>
</div>

<p>Which of these forms you use is purely a matter of taste. I like the
second one because it makes the logic easier to see at a glance.</p>

<h4 id="sneaky-supporters">Sneaky Supporters</h4>

<p>There may be times when you’d like to force the player to examine a
supporter before the game reveals what’s on it. By default, Inform
<em>will</em> list what’s on a scenery supporter in a room description.
If you don’t like this effect, you can override it globally (that is,
everywhere in your game) like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The describe what&apos;s on scenery supporters in room descriptions rule is not listed in any rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The describe what's on scenery supporters in room descriptions rule is not listed in any rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>When you add this line, the player will have to examine scenery
supporters in order to see what’s on them &ndash; and you’ll have to use the
code given a few paragraphs back to insure that the things on all of
your supporters will appear in response to an EXAMINE command. It’s a
bit rude to expect the player to understand that you’ve set up a little
extra mystery, unless there’s a purpose for the mystery. Usually, less
drastic measures would be preferable.</p>

<p>If you want to force the player to examine the billiard table to
notice the cue ball that’s lying on it, but you want that effect to
apply <em>only</em> to the billiard table, not to any other supporter in
the game, the way to do it is, first, <em>not</em> to make the table
scenery, and second, to add a “rule for writing a paragraph about.”
Here’s an example that does this. Notice that we’re not mentioning the
billiard table in the room description of the Billiard Room, because the
table is not scenery, so Inform will add a paragraph about it after the
room description, using the new rule we’ve added:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Billiard Room is a room. &quot;Comfortable-looking leather chairs stand against the oak-paneled walls of this room. Overhead, a single hooded light fixture shines down.&quot;\n\nThe billiard table is a supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is &quot;The billiard table is big and green.&quot;\n\nThe white ball and the cue chalk are on the table. The indefinite article of the cue chalk is &quot;a piece of&quot;. Understand “piece” as the cue chalk.\n\nRule for writing a paragraph about the billiard table:\n\tsay &quot;A handsomely appointed billiard table dominates the center of the room.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Billiard Room is a room. "Comfortable-looking leather chairs stand against the oak-paneled walls of this room. Overhead, a single hooded light fixture shines down."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The billiard table is a supporter in the Billiard Room. The description is "The billiard table is big and green."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The white ball and the cue chalk are on the table. The indefinite article of the cue chalk is "a piece of". Understand “piece” as the cue chalk.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for writing a paragraph about the billiard table:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "A handsomely appointed billiard table dominates the center of the room."</div>
</div>

<p>This produces the desired result: The player has to X TABLE to notice
the ball and the chalk.</p>

<h3 id="looking-under-looking-behind">Looking Under &amp; Looking Behind</h3>

<p>Experienced IF players know that authors like to hide things under
other things &ndash; under a bed, for example. When a player enters a room and
sees a bed, he’s bound to try LOOK UNDER BED before very long. Inform’s
default response is, “You find nothing of interest.” Creating a
non-default response is easy:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of looking under the bed:\n\tsay &quot;Nothing but dust bunnies.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of looking under the bed:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Nothing but dust bunnies."</div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="../RB_6.html#section_6">RB 6.6</a>, you’ll find
several ideas about how to hide things under other things. If we want
to, we can have the player “find” something by moving it from off-stage
into the room, or directly into the player’s inventory, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The odd sock is a thing. The odd sock can be found. The odd sock is not found.\n\nInstead of looking under the bed:\n\tif the odd sock is found:\n\t\tsay &quot;There&apos;s nothing else of interest under there, just a few dust bunnies.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tnow the odd sock is found;\n\t\tnow the player carries the odd sock;\n\t\tsay &quot;Under the bed you find an odd sock, which you retrieve.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The odd sock is a thing. The odd sock can be found. The odd sock is not found.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of looking under the bed:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the odd sock is found:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "There's nothing else of interest under there, just a few dust bunnies.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the odd sock is found;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the odd sock;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Under the bed you find an odd sock, which you retrieve."</div>
</div>

<p>This works nicely, up to a point. For your first game, it may be all
you want or need. But there are at least two potential problems lurking
here (leaving aside the possibility that the player will try to pick up
the dust bunnies and learn that she can’t see any such thing). First, it
won’t be possible to put anything (including the sock) under the
bed:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>put sock under bed</div>
<p>I didn't understand that sentence.</p>
</div>

<p>And second, if your game limits the number of items the player can
carry at once, giving the sock to the player automatically (as shown
above) may cause the player to be carrying more than the allowed number
of things. I’ve found that this can trip up Inform’s process of
automatically inserting excess items into the player’s holdall (a handy
bag for carrying excess inventory).</p>

<p>This is a good reason for moving the sock into the room rather than
adding it directly to the player’s inventory. But then the player has to
TAKE SOCK as an extra command, which is a bit annoying. If the player
  finds the sock, shouldn’t picking it up happen at the same time?</p>

<p>Another way to hide the odd sock under the bed is to include
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Underside-v6.i7x">Underside by Eric Eve</a>. This is a handy extension. Once this extension
has been included in your game, hiding the sock under the bed is
easier:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The double bed is a supporter in the Bedroom. The double bed is fixed in place. An underside called under#bed is part of the double bed.\n\nThe odd sock is in under#bed.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The double bed is a supporter in the Bedroom. The double bed is fixed in place. An underside called under#bed is part of the double bed.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The odd sock is in under#bed.</div>
</div>

<p>The name “under#bed” is not special; it’s just a good idea to use a
name that the player is not likely to type.</p>

<p>When an object is in an underside, it won’t be mentioned in a room
description, and it won’t be included in the object list if the player
tries to TAKE ALL.</p>

<p>There is no extension for hiding things behind other things. Most
often, if you want to do this, you’d be hiding something behind a
picture on the wall, or behind a couch, and the way to let the player
find it would be with the command TAKE PICTURE or MOVE COUCH. Inform
does not include looking behind as an action, though. Here’s how to set
that up:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Looking behind is an action applying to one thing and requiring light. Understand &quot;look behind [something]&quot; as looking behind.\n\nCheck looking behind:\n\tsay &quot;You find nothing interesting behind [the noun].&quot;\n\nInstead of looking behind the couch:\n\tsay &quot;It&apos;s jammed up against the wall. In order to see what&apos;s behind it, if anything, you&apos;ll need to pull it out from the wall.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Looking behind is an action applying to one thing and requiring light. Understand "look behind [something]" as looking behind.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check looking behind:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You find nothing interesting behind [the noun]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of looking behind the couch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It's jammed up against the wall. In order to see what's behind it, if anything, you'll need to pull it out from the wall."</div>
</div>

<p>Pulling something away from the wall would require another action, as
well as a way to test the position of the couch within the room. Is it
against the wall, or has it been moved? Let’s add that possibility:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The couch is in the Living Room. The couch can be moved or not moved. The couch is not moved. The description is &quot;An overstuffed couch stands [if not moved]against the wall[otherwise]in the middle of the room[end if].&quot;\nInstead of pushing the couch:\n\ttry pulling the couch.\nInstead of pulling the couch:\n\tif the couch is moved:\n\t\tsay &quot;It&apos;s already out in the middle of the room.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tnow the couch is moved;\n\t\tmove the odd sock to the Living Room;\n\t\tsay &quot;As you wrestle the couch out into the middle of the room, you find an odd sock behind it.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The couch is in the Living Room. The couch can be moved or not moved. The couch is not moved. The description is "An overstuffed couch stands [if not moved]against the wall[otherwise]in the middle of the room[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of pushing the couch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try pulling the couch.</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of pulling the couch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the couch is moved:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It's already out in the middle of the room.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the couch is moved;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the odd sock to the Living Room;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "As you wrestle the couch out into the middle of the room, you find an odd sock behind it."</div>
</div>

<p>Allowing the player to push the couch back against the wall would be
a bit more complicated. For one thing, you’d have to make sure that the
odd sock wouldn’t keep popping back into the room each time the couch
was moved.</p>

<p>A simpler solution might be to implement the LOOK BEHIND action and
then simply drag the hidden object into the game from offstage when the
player uses the command:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Library is a room. &quot;A beautiful tapestry hangs from the wall here.&quot;\n\nA beautiful tapestry is scenery in the Library. &quot;Sir Lancelot is depicted in vivid DayGlo stitchery.

</div>
<p>If you do it this way, you might want to add the following, as a
  courtesy to the player who tries MOVE TAPESTRY or SHAKE TAPESTRY:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of pushing the tapestry:\n\ttry looking behind the tapestry.\n\nShaking is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.

</div>

<p>This is the first place in the <em>Handbook</em> where we’ve added
new actions (looking behind and shaking). In Chapter 4 you’ll learn much
more about how to do this.</p>

<h3 id="take-all">Take All</h3>

<p>Since the TAKE ALL command came up in the section on “Looking Under
&amp; Looking Behind,” we may as well take a quick look at how to deal
with it. Experienced IF players have a tendency to type TAKE ALL
whenever they enter a new room, just to see what’s lying around that
isn’t nailed down. This is a useful command, and many players feel it’s
their right to be able to use it. If you disable it entirely, some
players may not be happy with your game. Earlier versions of Inform
tried to let the player take even scenery objects (after which the
player would learn that the scenery objects were not portable) and
people (leading to a report that the person wouldn’t care for that).
This was all rather silly. In the current version of Inform (and most
likely in the future as well), TAKE ALL does not include people or
scenery. This is described in <a href="../WI_18.html#section_36">WI 18.36 Deciding
whether all includes</a>.</p>

<p>We might decide to let “all” include a particular scenery item,
perhaps because the player’s attempt to take it will reveal something
interesting. Unfortunately, WI 18.36 fails to provide
a correct explanation of how to re-include something in ALL. Here’s the
correct way to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The billiard table is scenery in the Recreation Room. \n\nInstead of taking the billiard table:\n\tsay &quot;It&apos;s much too heavy for you to pick up, but when you try to lift it, it rocks slightly, as if the floor beneath it is uneven.&quot;\n\nRule for deciding whether all includes the billiard table while taking or taking off or removing: it does.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The billiard table is scenery in the Recreation Room. </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the billiard table:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It's much too heavy for you to pick up, but when you try to lift it, it rocks slightly, as if the floor beneath it is uneven."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for deciding whether all includes the billiard table while taking or taking off or removing: it does.</div>
</div>

<p>We have to include the list of actions (taking or taking off or
removing) because the Inform compiler assembles its lists of the rules
in your game in a particular way (as discussed in the next chapter).
More specific rules are listed before rules that are more general (less
specific). The library’s rule for TAKE ALL lists those actions, so if we
fail to mention them in our rule, our rule will be placed <em>after</em>
the standard “rule for deciding whether all includes scenery”. If our
customized rule is placed after the standard rule rule, our rule will
never be used.</p>

<h3 id="enterable-containers-supporters"><strong>Enterable Containers &amp; Supporters</strong></h3>

<p>Some containers and supporters might be big enough that the player
could reasonably enter them &ndash; a chair or bed, for instance. Here is a
simple example that includes both:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Bedroom is a room. &quot;Your basic bedroom. It&apos;s equipped with a bed and a chair.&quot;\n\nThe bed is an enterable scenery supporter in the Bedroom. The chair is an open enterable scenery container in the Bedroom.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Bedroom is a room. "Your basic bedroom. It's equipped with a bed and a chair."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The bed is an enterable scenery supporter in the Bedroom. The chair is an open enterable scenery container in the Bedroom.</div>
</div>

<p>The player will get able to GET IN BED or SIT ON BED, but not LIE IN
BED or LIE DOWN IN BED, because the action “lie in” has not been
defined. If you aren’t sure how to make a new action, turn to Chapter 4
of the <em>Handbook,</em> “Actions.” The standard command used by the
player to get out of an enterable container is STAND (or STAND UP, or
EXIT). Annoyingly, GET OUT OF BED is not recognized by the parser. In
order to handle this command, we need to write a little extra code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Getting out of is an action applying to one thing.\nUnderstand &quot;get out of [something]&quot; as getting out of.\n\nCarry out getting out of something:\n\ttry exiting instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Getting out of is an action applying to one thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "get out of [something]" as getting out of.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out getting out of something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try exiting instead.</div>
</div>

<p>When an openable container is enterable, the player will be allowed
to close it from the inside. Inform understands that the inside of a
closed container is dark, so if the player enters the container and then
closes it, the player will be in darkness &ndash; unless carrying a light
source, of course.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The refrigerator is an openable enterable container in the Kitchen.\nThe description is &quot;An old white General Electric fridge.&quot;\nUnderstand &quot;fridge&quot; as the refrigerator.\nThe refrigerator is open.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The refrigerator is an openable enterable container in the Kitchen.</div>
<div class="codeline">The description is "An old white General Electric fridge."</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "fridge" as the refrigerator.</div>
<div class="codeline">The refrigerator is open.</div>
</div>

<p>By default, the player will be allowed to pick up things that are in
the room (that is, on the floor) even when in or on an enterable
container or supporter. This is not too realistic, so you might want to
prevent it. I’m a little nervous about the syntax of the next bit of
code, because at any given moment either C or S will be nothing &hellip; but
it seems to work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before taking something:\n\tif the player is enclosed by an enterable container (called C) or the player is enclosed by an enterable supporter (called S):\n\t\tif the noun is not enclosed by C and the noun is not enclosed by S:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t reach [the noun] from here.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before taking something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is enclosed by an enterable container (called C) or the player is enclosed by an enterable supporter (called S):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is not enclosed by C and the noun is not enclosed by S:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You can't reach [the noun] from here." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>The syntax shown above, in which we use the phrases “(called C)” and
“(called S)” to create temporary local values for things so that we can
test them, is one that you’ll use a lot in writing if-tests in
Inform.</p>

<p>If the player is on an enterable supporter or in an enterable
container, trying to go somewhere will cause the parser to print out the
message “You would have to get off [the supporter] first.” This is
realistic, but a bit annoying, since the player knew what she wanted to
do. Here’s an easy way to fix it, suggested by Michael Callaghan:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of going when the player is on a supporter (called S):\n\tsay &quot;(First getting off the [printed name of S])[command clarification break]&quot;;\n\tsurreptitiously move the player to the holder of S;\n\tcontinue the action.\n\nInstead of going when the player is in a container (called C):\n\tsay &quot;(First getting out of the [printed name of C])[command clarification break]&quot;;\n\tsurreptitiously move the player to the holder of C;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of going when the player is on a supporter (called S):</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;surreptitiously move the player to the holder of S;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going when the player is in a container (called C):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "(First getting out of the [printed name of C])[command clarification break]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;surreptitiously move the player to the holder of C;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="moving-things-around">Moving Things Around</h3>

<p>You can expect that during the game, the player will pick things up,
carry them around, and drop them. But sometimes you need to move them
yourself, in your own code. For instance, if the player rubs the magic
lamp, you would probably want to move the genie into the room. The
keyword for doing this is “now”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of rubbing the lamp:\n\tif the genie is off-stage:\n\t\tnow the genie is in the location;\n\t\tsay &quot;Shazam! A genie appears!&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;You make a small squeaking noise by rubbing the lamp.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of rubbing the lamp:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the genie is off-stage:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the genie is in the location;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Shazam! A genie appears!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You make a small squeaking noise by rubbing the lamp."</div>
</div>

<p>In this case, “the location” refers to the room where the player is.
If you need to move an object to a container or supporter, it’s usually
easiest to refer to the container or supporter by name:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the knockwurst is on the plate;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the knockwurst is on the plate;</div>
</div>

<p>But sometimes you may not know exactly where the object should show
up. That can happen, for instance, if you’re transforming an old shoe
into a jewelled crown. In this case the shoe could be almost anywhere,
so you need to figure out where it is, store that data, and then use the
data to move the jewelled crown onstage:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of the player rubbing the lamp:\n\tif the holder of the old shoe is not nothing:\n\t\tlet H be the holder of the old shoe;\n\t\tmove the jewelled crown to H;\n\t\tremove the old shoe from play;\n\t\tsay &quot;You rub the old lamp. Squeak, squeak[if the player is in the location of the jewelled crown]. The old shoe turns into a jewelled crown![else].&quot;;\n\telse:\n\t\tsay &quot;You rub the old lamp. Squeak, squeak.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of the player rubbing the lamp:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the holder of the old shoe is not nothing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let H be the holder of the old shoe;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the jewelled crown to H;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;remove the old shoe from play;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You rub the old lamp. Squeak, squeak[if the player is in the location of the jewelled crown]. The old shoe turns into a jewelled crown![else].";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;else:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You rub the old lamp. Squeak, squeak."</div>
</div>

<p>As the code above shows, you can’t move something off-stage by saying
“now the X is off-stage”. The way to do it is to say “remove the X from
play”. This code also does a little testing to make sure that the old
shoe hasn’t already been moved off-stage. If we didn’t test that, then
rubbing the lamp a second time would produce a run-time error, because
the game would have tried to move the jewelled crown to nothing. As the
Inform 6 <em>Designer’s Manual</em> emphasizes, nothing is not a thing.
That’s why we have to use a special phrase (“remove the old shoe from
play”) to put the shoe nowhere.</p>

<p>This code also suggests a way of getting the proper vertical spacing
in the output. Notice the way the punctuation and conditional clauses
(“[if the player]”) are organized. Doing it a different way will produce
an ugly, non-standard output.</p>

<p>For an example of how to move a bunch of indistinguishable objects at
once using a loop, see the <a href="#Ref_dollar_bill">dollar bill example</a>.</p>

<p>I once had a beginning student try to add an item to the player’s
inventory (for a discussion of inventory, see below) by saying exactly
that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`add the sword to the player&apos;s inventory. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">add the sword to the player's inventory. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>You might think that would work, but it won’t, first because there is
no container in the model world called “inventory” and second because
“add” refers to an arithmetic operation, not to moving an object around
in the world. The way to give the sword to the player as an item being
carried is this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the player carries the sword.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the player carries the sword.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="inventory">Inventory</h3>

<p>When the player types INVENTORY, INV, or simply I, Inform will print
out a list of what the player is carrying or wearing. This list can be
formatted in various ways &ndash; as a column, as a sentence, and so on. For
details on how to do this, see <a href="../RB_6.html#section_7">RB 6.7: Inventory</a>, especially <a href="../examples/equipment_list.html">Example 177: Equipment List</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re writing a game that tries to be realistic, allowing the
player to carry 20 or 30 things at once is a bit silly (unless the
player character is an alien with 20 or 30 hands). Some game authors
prefer to limit the number of items the player can carry at once. As
explained in <a href="../WI_3.html#section_19">WI 3.19: Carrying capacity</a>, we can easily set this up by saying:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The carrying capacity of the player is 5.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The carrying capacity of the player is 5.</div>
</div>

<p>Players don’t like having a limited carrying capacity, because it’s a
huge hassle to have the game keep telling them, “You’re carrying too
many things already” when they try to pick up something new. The
solution is to put a <strong>holdall</strong><span id="Ref_holdall"
class="anchor"></span> container somewhere in the game &ndash; preferably in a
place where the player will find it early in the game. The holdall could
be a shopping bag, a backpack, a burlap sack, or whatever fits with your
story. Creating a holdall is easy:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The backpack is an open container in the Barn. The backpack is a\nplayer’s holdall.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The backpack is an open container in the Barn. The backpack is a</div>
<div class="codeline">player’s holdall.</div>
</div>

<p>When this container is added, here’s what happens as the player tries
to load down with more objects than the carrying capacity. In this
example, the carrying capacity of the player is 5. The player is already
holding the backpack and the flaming torch.</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p>You can see a banana, a peach, a kumquat, a pear, an apple, an orange
and a bowling ball here.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take all</div>

<p>banana: Taken.</p>

<p>peach: Taken.</p>

<p>kumquat: Taken.</p>

<p>pear: (putting the banana into the backpack to make room)</p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<p>apple: (putting the peach into the backpack to make room)</p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<p>orange: (putting the kumquat into the backpack to make room)</p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<p>bowling ball: (putting the pear into the backpack to make room)</p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>i</div>

<p>You are carrying:</p>

<p>a bowling ball</p>

<p>an orange</p>

<p>an apple</p>

<p>a flaming torch (providing light)</p>

<p>a backpack (open)</p>

<p>a pear</p>

<p>a kumquat</p>

<p>a peach</p>

<p>a banana</p>
</div>

<p>If the player is carrying the holdall, when the player tries to pick
up too many things at once, Inform will shuffle the excess items into
the holdall automatically, like this:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/i7/archive/blob/master/Jon%20Ingold/Considerate%20Holdall.i7x">Considerate Holdall by Jon Ingold</a> is an extension that improves on
Inform’s basic concept of a holdall. At present (February 2015) it’s not
compatible with 6L38, but editing it turns out to be not a huge problem.
(See Appendix B.) One useful thing that this extension adds is the idea
that the author can insist that certain things ought not to be shuffled
into the holdall at any time. If the player is carrying, say, a small
rodent or a plate of cookies, stashing them in the holdall would
probably be a bad idea. Even without this extension, Inform will
understand that something providing light (such as a flaming torch)
shouldn’t be deposited in the holdall &ndash; but it will have no hesitation
  about tossing the rodent in with the plate of cookies.</p>

<div class="addendum">Considerate Holdall remains unavailable for 9.3/6M62.</div>

<p>If you want to make your game more realistic, you may want to think
not just about the sheer number of items the player may want to pick up,
but about their bulk. The extension called Bulk Limiter by Eric Eve
allows you to assign a bulk to any object and a bulk capacity to any
container. This extension is handy for a couple of reasons. With a
little care, you can prevent silly things like having the player put a
chair in his pocket. And if there are numerous bulky objects around
(say, a chair, a string bass, and a shipping trunk), you can easily set
the game up so that the player will only be able to carry one of them at
a time. Your code might look something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The bulk capacity of the player is 65.\nThe bulk of the chair is 45.\nThe bulk of the string bass is 50.\nThe bulk of the shipping trunk is 40.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The bulk capacity of the player is 65.</div>
<div class="codeline">The bulk of the chair is 45.</div>
<div class="codeline">The bulk of the string bass is 50.</div>
<div class="codeline">The bulk of the shipping trunk is 40.</div>
</div>

<p>Bulk Limiter is not a perfect solution to all problems of this sort.
It doesn’t give us any tools with which to handle long, thin objects
that might not fit into a container. Also, if the player is prevented
from picking up something bulky while carrying several things that are
small, Bulk Limiter will just refuse the action; it won’t shuffle the
small things into a holdall automatically.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="things-to-think-about">
<h4>Things to Think About</h4>

<p>In the simplest interactive fiction games, every portable thing in
the game is useful for solving one puzzle. After the player has figured
out that he can use the bent hairpin to unlock the jewel box, he can
safely discard the hairpin, because it won’t be needed again. Your game
will be more interesting for players if you add variety to this
scheme.</p>

<ul>
<li>Two or three of the things you create might have multiple uses.</li>
<li>Two or three of your puzzles might have two solutions using
different things.</li>
<li>One or two objects might be <em>red herrings.</em> They might not
be good for anything at all.</li>
<li>One object or obstacle that appears to be a puzzle might also be a
red herring. It have no solution at all.</li></ul>

<h3 id="testing-where-a-thing-is">Testing Where a Thing Is</h3>

<p>In writing a game, it’s often very useful to be able to test where
something is. If the time bomb is in the suitcase, for instance, and the
player is carrying the suitcase or just in the room with the suitcase,
we might want to print out “You hear a faint ticking noise” once every
few turns.</p>

<p>Inform has several words for describing and testing where things are.
It’s important to use the right word, because if you use the wrong one,
your test may fail, causing a bug in your game. These words are ways of
describing <a href="#relations">relations</a>. Relations (see <a href="../WI_13.html#section_3">
WI 13.3: What are relations?</a>) are an
important and versatile concept in advanced Inform programming. The
relations that relate to where things are located are the containment,
support, incorporation, carrying, wearing, and possession relations.</p>

<p>Internally, your game has a <em>containment hierarchy</em>. This is a
fancy way of saying that Inform knows when object A is inside of or on
object B, while object B is inside of or on object C, while object C is
… and so on. The relationships between objects in the hierarchy will be
one or another of these relations. For instance, if object A is inside
object B, they are related by the containment relation.</p>

<p>A room is always at the top of the hierarchy: it’s not possible for
one room to be inside another room &ndash; though we can fake this easily by
creating a new room that’s inside from another room. In this case,
Inform understands that “inside” is just another direction, like north
or down. This fact is mentioned in <a href="../WI_3.html#section_2>WI 3.2: Rooms and the map</a>.</p>

<p>If the aspirin tablet is in the pill box, the pill box is in the
suitcase, the leather suitcase on the table, and the old oak table in
the Dining Room, the containment hierarchy would look like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Dining Room\n\told oak table\n\t\tleather suitcase\n\t\t\tpill box\n\t\t\t\taspirin tablet\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Dining Room</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;old oak table</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;leather suitcase</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;pill box</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;aspirin tablet</div>
</div>
<p>The words “in” and “on” mean just what you think they should &ndash; and
they refer only to things that are <em>directly</em> in a container (or
room) or on a supporter. In the hierarchy shown above, the table is in
the Dining Room, but the leather suitcase is <em>not</em> in the Dining
Room. Likewise, the suitcase is on the table, but the pill box is
<em>not</em> on the table. Because Inform distinguishes “in” from “on,”
the table is not “on” the Dining Room, and the suitcase is not “in” the
table.</p>

<p>We can test whether the player (or another character) carries an
item. Like on and in, “carries” only refers to things that the player
carries directly. If the player carries the pill box, and the aspirin
tablet is in the pill box, the result of the test “if the player carries
the aspirin tablet” will be false.</p>

<p>Inform’s most general term for testing where a thing is is “enclosed
by”. In the example above, the aspirin tablet is enclosed by
<em>everything</em> above it in the containment hierarchy &ndash; the pill
box, the leather suitcase, the old oak table, and the Dining room.</p>

<p>We can reverse these terms if we like. We can say, “if the Dining
Room encloses the pill box”. This will be true if “if the pill box is
enclosed by the Dining Room” is true.</p>

<p>The <strong>location</strong> of a thing is always the room, as
<a href="WI_3.html#section_25">WI 3.25: the location
of something</a>) points out. In the diagram above, the location of every
object (except the Dining Room itself) is the Dining Room.</p>

<p>We can test whether two objects are sitting next to one another &ndash; in
the same container, on the same supporter, carried by the same person,
or in the same room &ndash; using the general-purpose term “holder”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the holder of the pear is the holder of the banana:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the holder of the pear is the holder of the banana:</div>
</div>

<p>This condition will be true if they’re both carried by the player, or
both in the same basket, or both on the floor of the room. But if the
player is holding the basket and the pear, while the banana is in the
basket, it will be false.</p>

<h3 id="things-can-have-properties">Things Can Have Properties</h3>

<p>Often, an object can stay the same from the beginning of the game to
the end. If the player finds a rock, for instance, that can be used to
hammer a nail, probably not too much will happen to the rock during the
course of the game. But it sometimes happens that we want to create an
object whose state can change during the course of the game because of
the player’s action. To keep track of what state the object is in, we
need to give it a <em>property.</em> “Property” is simply computer
programming jargon for an attribute or characteristic. To put it another
way, the properties of an object are variables that are stored within
the object &ndash; variables that may change depending on what the player does
with or to the object.</p>

<p>Properties can be of two types. Some of them are numbers, while
others are words or groups of words. They’re similar in some ways, but
let’s look at them one at a time.</p>

<h4 id="number-properties">Number Properties</h4>

<p>Attaching a named number to an object (making it a property of the
object) is very simple. To show how it works, we’ll create a lamp that
will run out of fuel after a certain number of turns:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a lamp. The lamp is lit. The lamp has a number called fuel-remaining. The fuel-remaining of the lamp is 50.\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif the fuel-remaining of the lamp is greater than 0:\n\t\tdecrease the fuel-remaining of the lamp by 1;\n\t\tif the fuel-remaining of the lamp is 0:\n\t\t\tnow the lamp is not lit;\n\t\t\tif the lamp is enclosed by the location:\n\t\t\t\tsay &quot;The lamp flickers and then goes out.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a lamp. The lamp is lit. The lamp has a number called fuel-remaining. The fuel-remaining of the lamp is 50.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fuel-remaining of the lamp is greater than 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;decrease the fuel-remaining of the lamp by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fuel-remaining of the lamp is 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the lamp is not lit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the lamp is enclosed by the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The lamp flickers and then goes out."</div>
</div>

<p>Number properties always have names &ndash; in this case, “fuel-remaining.”
We can manipulate them however we like. If this is an oil lamp, for
instance, the player might be able to refill it from an oil can. Here’s
a somewhat oversimplified way to do exactly that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The oil can is here. The oil can can be full or empty. The oil can is full.\n\nRefilling is an action applying to one thing. Understand &quot;fill [something]&quot; and &quot;refill [something]&quot; as refilling.\n\nCheck refilling:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] can&apos;t be refilled.&quot; instead.\n\nInstead of refilling the lamp:\n\tif the oil can is enclosed by the location:\n\t\tif the oil can is full:\n\t\t\tnow the oil can is empty;\n\t\t\tincrease the fuel-remaining of the lamp by 50;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You drain the oil can into the lamp[run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\t\t\tif the lamp is not lit:\n\t\t\t\tnow the lamp is lit;\n\t\t\t\tsay &quot;, and quite magically the lamp&apos;s mantle begins glowing brightly again[run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;.&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;The oil can appears to be empty.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;You have nothing to fill the lamp with.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The oil can is here. The oil can can be full or empty. The oil can is full.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Refilling is an action applying to one thing. Understand "fill [something]" and "refill [something]" as refilling.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check refilling:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] can't be refilled." instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of refilling the lamp:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the oil can is enclosed by the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the oil can is full:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the oil can is empty;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the fuel-remaining of the lamp by 50;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You drain the oil can into the lamp[run paragraph on]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the lamp is not lit:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the lamp is lit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say ", and quite magically the lamp's mantle begins glowing brightly again[run paragraph on]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say ".";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The oil can appears to be empty.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You have nothing to fill the lamp with."</div>
</div>

<p>This code is oversimplified in several ways. For one thing, I’ve
ignored the fact that the player would need a lighted match in order to
re-light an oil lamp after it had burned out. Also, we would expect that
the player would have to be holding the oil can in order to refill the
lamp. The main thing this example is designed to show is the properties
fuel-remaining (of the lamp) and full or empty (of the oil can).</p>

<h4 id="word-properties">Word Properties</h4>

<p>The easiest way to add word properties to an object is by simply
listing the words. In this case, what we have is an anonymous (nameless)
property. For instance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a potato. The potato can be cold, warm, or\nhot.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a potato. The potato can be cold, warm, or</div>
<div class="codeline">hot.</div>
</div>

<p>Presumably the player will be able to do something during the game
that will change the temperature of the potato. It’s good practice
always to tell Inform what condition you want the object to be in at the
start of the game. This removes any possible ambiguity, and makes your
code easier to read:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a potato. The potato can be cold, warm, or hot.\nThe potato is cold.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a potato. The potato can be cold, warm, or hot.</div>
<div class="codeline">The potato is cold.</div>
</div>

<p>If you don’t tell Inform which of the conditions you want the object
to start out in, Inform will make an assumption &ndash; but its assumption may
not be what you intended. Just to make our lives more interesting, if
you give the potato’s anonymous property only two possible values
(perhaps cold and hot) and fail to tell Inform what state the potato
starts out in, the compiler will put the potato in the <em>second</em>
of the two states. But if you give a list of three possible states,
Inform will initialize the potato object in the <em>first</em> of the
possible states.</p>

<p>The method you use to change the state of an object will, of course,
depend on the nature of the object and also on the type of puzzle you’re
implementing. Here’s a simple example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.\n\nAfter inserting the potato into the blazing fireplace:\n\tnow the potato is hot;\n\tsay &quot;You drop the potato into the blazing fireplace, and in a few moments the potato is glowing cherry red and smoldering cheerfully.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n\nInstead of taking the potato when the potato is hot:\n\tsay &quot;You&apos;d burn your fingers.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After inserting the potato into the blazing fireplace:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the potato is hot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You drop the potato into the blazing fireplace, and in a few moments the potato is glowing cherry red and smoldering cheerfully.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the potato when the potato is hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd burn your fingers."</div>
</div>

<p>But letting the player do something that will make the potato hot is
only the first step in implementing the puzzle. If the player should
happen to refer to the object as a hot potato, the parser will report,
“You can’t see any such thing.” So we need to instruct the parser about
the vocabulary. Let’s omit, for now, the option of a warm potato, and
create one that can be either cold or hot:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The potato can be cold or hot. The potato is cold. Understand &quot;hot&quot;\nas the potato when the potato is hot. The description of the potato is\n&quot;It&apos;s brown and a bit lumpy[if hot]. It&apos;s also glowing with heat[end\nif].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The potato can be cold or hot. The potato is cold. Understand "hot"</div>
<div class="codeline">as the potato when the potato is hot. The description of the potato is</div>
<div class="codeline">"It's brown and a bit lumpy[if hot]. It's also glowing with heat[end</div>
<div class="codeline">if]."</div>
</div>

<p>If there are several things in the game that might end up being too
hot to pick up because they’ve been put in the fireplace, we might want
to write a more general rule, along these lines:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking something when the noun is hot:\n\tsay &quot;You&apos;d burn your fingers.&quot; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking something when the noun is hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd burn your fingers." [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t work as expected. For some reason, Inform
will assume that every object has the second value of the anonymous
two-state property. Because we said “The potato can be cold or hot,” the
parser will assume that <em>everything</em> is hot. We could get around
this by saying, “The potato can be hot or cold,” but here’s a safer way
to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing can be hot or cold. A thing is usually cold.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A thing can be hot or cold. A thing is usually cold.</div>
</div>

<p>Now all of the objects in your game will be explicitly cold, so the
general-purpose Instead rule above will work with the potato, the poker,
the gold doubloon, or anything else that you let the player put in the
blazing fireplace.</p>

<p>But let’s suppose that you want some things to have a variable
temperature, while other things don’t need this property. So you decide
to be clever. You create temperature as a kind of value, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Temperature is a kind of value. The temperatures are cold, warm, and hot.\n\nThe Library is a room. A toad is in the Library. The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.\n\nThe player carries a potato. The potato has a temperature. Understand &quot;hot&quot; as the potato when the potato is hot. The description of the potato is &quot;It&apos;s brown and a bit lumpy[if hot]. It&apos;s also glowing with heat[end if].&quot;\n\nAfter inserting the potato into the blazing fireplace:\n\tnow the potato is hot;\n\tsay &quot;You drop the potato into the blazing fireplace, and in a few moments the potato is glowing cherry red and smoldering cheerfully.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n\nInstead of taking something when the noun is hot:\n\tsay &quot;You&apos;d burn your fingers.&quot; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Temperature is a kind of value. The temperatures are cold, warm, and hot.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Library is a room. A toad is in the Library. The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries a potato. The potato has a temperature. Understand "hot" as the potato when the potato is hot. The description of the potato is "It's brown and a bit lumpy[if hot]. It's also glowing with heat[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After inserting the potato into the blazing fireplace:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the potato is hot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You drop the potato into the blazing fireplace, and in a few moments the potato is glowing cherry red and smoldering cheerfully.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking something when the noun is hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd burn your fingers." [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>If you try this miniature game, it will compile, but when you test it
with the command TAKE TOAD, you’ll get a run-time error:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take toad</div>
<p>[** Programming error: tried to read (something) **]</p>
<p>Taken.</p>
</div>

<p>What has happened, in this case, is that the toad doesn’t have a
temperature property, so trying to test whether it’s hot (using the
Instead rule) can’t possibly work. You might think to try dodging the
problem like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking something:\n\tif the noun provides the temperature property:\n\t\tif the noun is hot:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;d burn your fingers.&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tcontinue the action;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun provides the temperature property:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd burn your fingers.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>This looks perfectly sensible &ndash; but it won’t compile. Why? If you
look back at the code given a little earlier, you’ll see that
temperature isn’t a property. It’s a kind of value. To you and me, the
difference between the two ideas may appear trivial, but Inform is fussy
about these sorts of things. Fortunately, there’s a solution, which was
suggested by Victor Gijsbers. We need to give the potato’s temperature a
distinct name, so that it isn’t an anonymous property. Once the property
has a name, we can test whether any object possesses that property. The
final version is a bit more wordy, but it works as needed:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Temperature is a kind of value. The temperatures are cold, warm, and hot.\n\nThe Library is a room. A toad is in the Library. The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.\n\nThe player carries a potato. The potato has a temperature called the heat. Understand &quot;hot&quot; as the potato when the heat of the potato is hot. The description of the potato is &quot;It&apos;s brown and a bit lumpy[if the heat of the potato is hot]. It&apos;s also glowing with heat[end if].&quot;\n\nInstead of taking something:\n\tif the noun provides the property heat:\n\t\tif the heat of the noun is hot:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;d burn your fingers.&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tcontinue the action;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Temperature is a kind of value. The temperatures are cold, warm, and hot.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Library is a room. A toad is in the Library. The blazing fireplace is an open scenery container in the Library.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries a potato. The potato has a temperature called the heat. Understand "hot" as the potato when the heat of the potato is hot. The description of the potato is "It's brown and a bit lumpy[if the heat of the potato is hot]. It's also glowing with heat[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun provides the property heat:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the heat of the noun is hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd burn your fingers.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>Because we’ve named the property “heat”, we can test whether any
object that the player might refer to during the game possesses the
property (called) heat.</p>

<p>Giving properties to objects is an extremely useful way of
controlling how the objects will function in a game. Number properties
are also useful; for more on this topic, you can consult <a href="../WI_4.html#section12">
WI 4.12: Values that vary</a>. In
this section of the <em>Handbook</em> we’ve concentrated on properties
that are lists of adjectives. We’ve seen how to create such a list
within a single object, how to apply it to all objects, and how to
create it as a separate kind of value that may or may not be applied to
any given object. We’ve also looked at how to change the description of
an object based on the current value of a property and how to let the
parser know that a word can be used to describe the object only when the
object’s property has a certain value. Finally, we’ve shown how to give
a property a name of its own, so as to be able to test whether the
object has that sort of property.</p>

<h3 id="plurals-collective-objects">Plurals &amp; Collective Objects</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier (in Chapter 2), some objects need to be plural &ndash;
for example, the tall old trees standing beside the forest path, or the
cows grazing in a nearby field. It’s usually not necessary to make every
tree a separate object. Instead, we make a single scenery object, and
give it the property plural-named. We can do this ourselves, by writing
“The tall old trees are plural-named”, or we can let Inform figure it
out, by using the word “some”. Let’s create a plural-named object that
isn’t scenery:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Some scissors are on the sewing table. The description is &quot;The\nscissors look quite sharp.&quot; Understand &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;blades&quot;, and &quot;shears&quot;\nas the scissors.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Some scissors are on the sewing table. The description is "The</div>
<div class="codeline">scissors look quite sharp." Understand "sharp", "blades", and "shears"</div>
<div class="codeline">as the scissors.</div>
</div>

<p>Because we said “Some scissors”, Inform will make the scissors
plural-named. So if it needs to mention the scissors &ndash; in an inventory
list, for instance &ndash; it will say “You are carrying some scissors” rather
than “You are carrying a scissors.”</p>

<p>If we need to create a collective object, such as sand or water, we
can’t use “some” in this way. Here’s the wrong way to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Some brackish water is in the pond. [Error!] The water is fixed in place.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Some brackish water is in the pond. [Error!] The water is fixed in place.</div>
</div>

<p>If the player tries TAKE WATER, the game will respond, “Those are
hardly portable.” Instead, we need to do it like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The brackish water is in the pond. The indefinite article of the brackish water is &quot;some&quot;. The water is fixed in place.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The brackish water is in the pond. The indefinite article of the brackish water is "some". The water is fixed in place.</div>
</div>

<p>When we do it this way, by telling Inform what the indefinite article
is, Inform understands that the water is not plural-named, but that it
should nevertheless say “some water”, not “a water”.</p>

<p>Quite often, we need to write text that will produce outputs for
various objects. In this case, we use “[the noun]” or “[a noun]” and let
Inform substitute whatever noun is currently being talked about. (The
substitutions “[the second noun]” and “[a second noun]” work the same
way.) But when we do this, we have to be careful about how we construct
the sentence. This looks correct, but it’s a bug:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`say &quot;[The noun] is too heavy for you to carry.&quot; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">say "[The noun] is too heavy for you to carry." [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>If the noun being referred to at the moment happens to be
plural-named, the output will be wrong:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take boulders</div>
<p>The boulders is too heavy for you to carry.</p>
</div>

<p>The old-school solution is to fix this by hand:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`say &quot;[The noun] [if the noun is plural-named]are[otherwise]is[end if] too heavy for you to carry.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">say "[The noun] [if the noun is plural-named]are[otherwise]is[end if] too heavy for you to carry."</div>
</div>

<p>Inserting an if-test within text in this way is sometimes an ideal
solution to a tricky problem. But when writing messages that may need to
refer to things that are plural-named it’s almost always more convenient
do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`say &quot;[The noun] [are] too heavy for you to carry.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">say "[The noun] [are] too heavy for you to carry."</div>
</div>

<p>This type of syntax used to require an extension called Plurality by
Emily Short, but it now works fine even without that extension, because
the concepts in Plurality have been built into Inform.</p>

<p><a href="../WI_4.html#section14">WI 4.14: Duplicates</a> shows how to create collections of indistinguishable
items. This is occasionally useful. For example, you might be
implementing an old-fashioned money system in which the player can have
a purse containing copper pennies, silver dollars, and gold eagles. The
coins within each group are identical, so it really doesn’t matter which
object the player picks up when using the command PICK UP PENNY.</p>

<p>But precisely because they’re identical, writing code that will move
one of them somewhere is slightly tricky. The way to do this is to refer
to “a random” object of that kind, in the location where you’re sure one
is to be found. Even if there’s only one object of the kind available,
you still have to refer to “a random” object of that kind.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Poultry Shop is a room.\n\nA coin is a kind of thing. Understand &quot;coin&quot; as a coin.\nA copper penny is a kind of coin.\nA silver dollar is a kind of coin.\nA gold eagle is a kind of coin.\n\nThe player carries three copper pennies, five silver dollars, and two gold eagles.\n\nThe shopkeeper is a man in the Poultry Shop. The shopkeeper carries a duck.\n\nInstead of buying the duck:\n\tif the shopkeeper carries the duck:\n\t\tlet P be a random copper penny carried by the player;\n\t\tif P is not nothing:\n\t\t\tnow the shopkeeper carries P;\n\t\t\tnow the player carries the duck;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You buy the duck from the shopkeeper for a penny.&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;&apos;I&apos;ll need a penny for this handsome duck,&apos; the shopkeeper says.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;ve already bought the duck.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Poultry Shop is a room.</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries three copper pennies, five silver dollars, and two gold eagles.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The shopkeeper is a man in the Poultry Shop. The shopkeeper carries a duck.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of buying the duck:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the shopkeeper carries the duck:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let P be a random copper penny carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if P is not nothing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the shopkeeper carries P;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the duck;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You buy the duck from the shopkeeper for a penny.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'I'll need a penny for this handsome duck,' the shopkeeper says.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You've already bought the duck."</div>
</div>

<p>One thing that’s worth noting about this code is that you have to
refer to objects of a kind using the <em>entire</em> term you used when
creating the kind. If you write “let P be a random penny” after creating
a kind called “copper penny”, Inform won’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>

<p>You may want to spend a moment studying how this Instead rule is
written. We can safely assume that the player is in a room where the
duck is visible, because if there’s no duck, the parser will never need
this Instead rule; it will simply reply, “You can’t see any such thing.”
So the first question to be asked is, does the shopkeeper still have the
duck? Could be yes, could be no. (We will ignore the possibility that
the shopkeeper may have hidden the duck under the counter; we’ll assume
that the only way he’s going to give it up is if you buy it.) The second
question is, does the player still have a penny to spend? Could be yes,
could be no.</p>

<p>Trapping all of the logical possibilities is a big part of IF
programming.</p>

<p>To return to the main topic of this section, once you’ve created some
indistinguishable objects, you’ll quickly discover that the game’s
output looks a bit clumsy:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>drop dollars</div>

<p>silver dollar: Dropped.</p>
<p>silver dollar: Dropped.</p>
<p>silver dollar: Dropped.</p>
<p>silver dollar: Dropped.</p>
<p>silver dollar: Dropped.</p>
</div>

<p>There’s nothing really wrong with this except that it looks like a
leftover from the 1980s. It doesn’t read well. The extension
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/9.3/John%20Clemens/Consolidated%20Multiple%20Actions.i7x">Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens</a> addressed this issue for
earlier versions of Inform. It was not initially compatible with 6L38,
but Emily Short has updated it. Hopefully it will be available on the
Public Library by the time you read this. Including this extension in
your game has no effect on the internal logic of the game (although it
does require that the game be compiled to Glulx, so it can’t be used in
.z8 games), but it changes the way the action is reported to the
player:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>drop dollars</div>

<p>You put down the five silver dollars.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="more-about-collections-kinds">More about Collections &amp; Kinds</h3>

<p>Inform lets you make either unique objects or kinds of objects. One
reason to make several objects of a given kind is because they’re
indistinguishable from one another, like the pennies in the section
“Plurals &amp; Collective Objects,” above. But sometimes we want to make
several objects of a single kind that are similar, yet different &ndash; for
example, the various kinds of fruit in the section <a href="#things-vs.-kinds">Things vs. Kinds</a>. When we do this,
the player may very reasonably want to perform an action on all of the
members of the kind at once (or at least, on all of the members that are
available at that point in the game). Persuading Inform to report the
action in a graceful way is not guaranteed to be simple.</p>

<p>The extension Consolidated Multiple Actions, as mentioned earlier,
can handle some of these situations, but not all of them. If you want
this extension to be used with any new actions you define in your game,
you’ll need to write a bit of extra code. This rather gross example
shows how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens.\n\nThe Test Lab is a room.\n\nMoe is a man in the Lab.\n\nA glop is a kind of thing.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Test Lab is a room.</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A glop is a kind of thing. The indefinite article of a glop is "some". Understand "glop" as a glop. Understand "glop" as the plural of glop.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The jelly is a glop. The glue is a glop. The taco sauce is a glop. The player carries the jelly, the glue, and the taco sauce.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Smearing it on is an action applying to two things and requiring light. Understand "smear [things] on [something]" as smearing it on.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report smearing it on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You smear [the noun] on [the second noun]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Last for reporting consolidated actions rule when smearing on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You smear [consolidated objects] on [the second noun]." </div>
</div>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>smear glop on moe</div>

<p>You smear the jelly, the glue and the taco sauce on Moe.</p>
</div>

<p>Consolidated Multiple Actions produces the output line &ndash; but in order
for it to do its work, you have to do two things. First, your new action
(in this example, the new action is called smearing it on) has to be
defined using the “[things]” token, so that it can be used with multiple
objects. Second, the action needs a “for reporting consolidated actions
rule”. Oddly enough, this rule has to be written for the action
“smearing on” rather than the action “smearing it on” &ndash; don’t ask me
why.</p>

<p>The third aspect of this example, creating a kind called glop, is
only a nice extra. Even if we hadn’t done this, Consolidated Multiple
Actions could handle a list of objects, like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>smear jelly and glue on moe</div>

<p>You smear the jelly and the glue on Moe.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also times when we would like the player to be able to
examine a group of related objects (such as several objects of the same
kind) and read a single result. The examining action can’t normally be
used by the player to look at more than one object at a time, so the
default response if you try to examine several things is, “You can’t use
multiple objects with that verb.” The method described in the old
edition of the <em>Handbook</em> for examining multiple objects no
longer works, because of improvements in the Inform parser. However, a
new and better way to get the same output is described in Example 295,
“The Left Hand of Autumn.” This example shows how to set up a
multiply-examining action that can handle several different lists of
items, so let’s see if we can simplify it a bit. The tricky part (if
you’re new to the rather twisty business of how Inform handles commands,
which we’ll get into in Chapter 4) is making sure the command processing
sequence does what we want it to, and then stops. This is the purpose of
the truth state called group-description-complete in the following
code.</p>

<p>For a simple example that shows how to consolidate the output
messages when a collection of objects can get into different states, see
the <a href="#broken-eggs">Broken Eggs example</a>.</p>

<h3 id="objects-that-have-parts">Objects That Have Parts</h3>

<p>In real life, most objects are made up of various parts. For
instance, an electric stove has heating elements (burners), perhaps an
oven built into it, and knobs for turning the burners on and off. Inform
lets us model a complex object like a stove by defining the other
objects that are its parts.</p>

<p>With simple objects such as a knife or a cup, there’s usually no need
to create separate objects to model the parts. We can just make the
names of the parts refer back to the main object, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a knife. The description is &quot;It’s a shiny Bowie knife with a sharp three-inch blade and a black leather hilt.&quot; Understand &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;Bowie&quot;, &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;blade&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;leather&quot;, and &quot;hilt&quot; as the knife.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a knife. The description is "It’s a shiny Bowie knife with a sharp three-inch blade and a black leather hilt." Understand "shiny", "Bowie", "sharp", "blade", "black", "leather", and "hilt" as the knife.</div>
</div>

<p>If the player types X BLADE or X HILT, the game will simply print out
the description of the knife. That may be all that we need. But with a
more complex object, adding parts is a good way of designing it. The
basics of how to do this are well explained on <a href="WI_3.html#section23">WI 3.23: Parts of things</a>. <a href="../examples/brown.html">Example 36: Brown</a> shows how to make parts that can be
detached and reattached. Unless our code detaches a part of an object,
it will always be part of the object. If the larger object is picked up
or dropped by the player, all of its parts will travel along with it
automatically.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of using parts is that in Inform, any single
object can be either a container or a supporter, but not both. If our
model world includes an object like a chest of drawers, we need to make
the chest itself a supporter (because the player may want to put things
on top of it), and make its drawers openable containers. Making the
drawers parts of the chest is a wise precaution: If you should later
change the design of the game to allow the chest of drawers to be moved
from place to place, the drawers will come along with it
automatically.</p>

<p><a href="../RB_8.html#section_4">RB 8.4</a> has some
examples showing how to make furniture. <a href="../examples/yolk_of_gold.html">Example 83: Yolk of Gold</a>, has
a complete implementation of a three-drawer dresser, with the added
feature that the player will always find what he’s looking for in the
last drawer he opens, no matter which drawer it is.</p>

<p>There are two ways to make something part of something else. We can
say:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The blade is part of the knife.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The blade is part of the knife.</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;or we can say:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The knife incorporates the blade.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The knife incorporates the blade.</div>
</div>

<p>Parts are detachable and attachable objects. This fact can be
extremely handy. Let’s suppose, for instance, that in your game you want
the player to be able to put a stamp on a postcard:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a postcard and a stamp. Understand &quot;card&quot; and &quot;post card&quot; as the postcard. Understand &quot;postage&quot; as the stamp. The description of the postcard is &quot;A plain white postcard[if the stamp is part of the postcard] with a stamp on it[end if].&quot;\n\nInstead of tying the stamp to the postcard:\n\tif the stamp is part of the postcard:\n\t\tsay &quot;You already did that.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tnow the stamp is part of the postcard;\n\t\tsay &quot;You lick the stamp and affix it to the postcard.&quot;\n\nTest me with &quot;x card / fasten stamp to card / x card / take stamp&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a postcard and a stamp. Understand "card" and "post card" as the postcard. Understand "postage" as the stamp. The description of the postcard is "A plain white postcard[if the stamp is part of the postcard] with a stamp on it[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of tying the stamp to the postcard:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the stamp is part of the postcard:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You already did that.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the stamp is part of the postcard;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You lick the stamp and affix it to the postcard."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with "x card / fasten stamp to card / x card / take stamp".</div>
</div>

<p>You may notice that the action provided by Inform is called tying it
to. The player is unlikely to try TIE STAMP TO POSTCARD, but the command
would work. The words ATTACH and FASTEN are used by Inform’s parser as
synonyms for TIE. If we want the player to be able to use the command
PUT STAMP ON CARD, however, we’ll have to do just a little more
work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of putting the stamp on the postcard:\n\ttry tying the stamp to the postcard.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of putting the stamp on the postcard:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try tying the stamp to the postcard.</div>
</div>

<p>The main point of the code above is that after the stamp has been
attached to the postcard, the player will get this output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take stamp</div>
<p>That seems to be a part of the postcard.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition, when the player picks up the postcard and carries it
around, the stamp will now be brought along for the ride. To learn how
to detach parts of objects, see the <a
href="#mr-potato-head">Mr. Potato Head example</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reading-matter">Reading Matter</h3>

<p>Inform’s standard rules assume that READ means the same thing as
EXAMINE. This is not a bad assumption for a simple game. In the case of
a roadside sign, the description of the sign would probably include the
text printed on the sign, so there’s no need to have a special reading
action. But in the case of a book or even a note on a piece of paper, we
may want to make reading a separate action. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing has some text called the reading-material. The reading-material of a thing is usually &quot;&quot;.\n\nThe book is in the Library.

The reading-material of the book is &quot;A fascinating discussion of the idiocies to which the human mind is susceptible.

<div class="codeline">Understand the command "read" as something new.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Reading is an action applying to one thing and requiring light.</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the reading-material of the noun is "":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Nothing is printed on [the noun].” instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out reading:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[reading-material of the noun]."</div>
</div>

<p>If your game also includes things like roadside signs, for which you
want READ to give the same result as EXAMINE, you could change the Check
rule like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check reading:\n\tif the reading-material of the noun is &quot;&quot;:\n\t\ttry examining the noun instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check reading:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the reading-material of the noun is "":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try examining the noun instead.</div>
</div>

<p>Another way to do it would be to leave the Check rule saying “Nothing
is printed on [the noun]” and add this for any signs:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of reading the roadside sign:\n\ttry examining the roadside sign.\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of reading the roadside sign:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try examining the roadside sign.</div>
  
</div>
<p>My first idea, in designing this example, was to start by saying, “A
thing can be legible or illegible. A thing is usually illegible.” But
after thinking about it for a minute, I realized I could simplify the
code. All the Check Reading rule needs to do is find out whether the
reading-material of the noun is “” (that is, whether it’s empty).
Anything that has text in its reading-material can now be read. Note
also that the reading-material of the book ends without a period. This
is because the period is at the end of the quoted bit in the Carry Out
Reading rule.</p>

<p>Another thing we might want to do in a game is create a book (or even
a computer) in which the player can look things up. The best way to do
this is by creating an action that uses the topics we want the player to
look up &ndash; see <a href="#actions-with-topics">Actions with Topics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="writing-on-things">Writing on Things</h3>

<p>A few years back, when I was teaching an IF programming class to some
younger students, One of them asked how to create a notepad that the
player could write things on. A real software notepad, in which you
could select words and sentences with the mouse, would be almost
impossible to create in an Inform game. But creating an in-game object,
such as a piece of paper or an old-fashioned slate, that the player can
write on is not terribly difficult.</p>

<p>An object like this might even be part of a puzzle: You could use it
to let the player leave a message for another character. After writing
this section of the <em>Handbook,</em> I expanded its ideas into the
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Jim%20Aikin/Notepad-v3.i7x">Notepad extension</a>. The extension includes an
example showing how to let a character respond to written commands. The
example below is more basic than the extension; it simply creates a
slate that the player can write on or erase. First we’ll create a new
kind of thing called a notepad. Then we’ll change the command READ
(which normally triggers the examining action) and add two new actions &ndash;
writing it on and erasing.</p>

<p>Most of this example could be copied straight across into your own
game. One detail that’s specific to the example is checking whether the
player is carrying the chalk before letting her write on the slate. If
your game uses a piece of paper as the notepad object, simply change the
piece of chalk to a pencil.</p>

<h3 id="mechanical-marvels">Mechanical Marvels</h3>

<p>Inform provides a kind of thing called a device<span id="Ref_device"
class="anchor"></span>. The idea is, if you want to create something
that can be switched on or off, you can call it a device. Inform will
then understand that the commands SWITCH ON and SWITCH OFF can be
applied to it (along with a few synonyms, such as TURN ON and TURN OFF).
A device keeps track of whether it’s switched on or switched off, so
this property can be tested in your code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the electric razor is switched on:\n\tnow the player is clean-shaven;\n\t[...and so on...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the electric razor is switched on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player is clean-shaven;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;and so on&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>The only other thing a device does, by default, is this: If the
player examines it, the game will report whether it’s currently switched
on or switched off. That’s okay if the device is something like an
electric fan, which has a large black plastic on/off switch with the
words ON and OFF printed on its mounting. It’s less desirable if the
device has no visible switch and doesn’t look any different when it’s
switched on. In that case, we might prefer to prevent Inform’s automatic
mention of the device’s on/off state. This can be done by removing the
rule that causes the state to print out, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The examine devices rule is not listed in any rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The examine devices rule is not listed in any rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>If you do this, it’s up to you to write a description for each device
that will alert the player to the device’s state:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description of the electric razor is &quot;It&apos;s a Remington cordless[if switched on]. At the moment it&apos;s humming faintly[end if].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description of the electric razor is "It's a Remington cordless[if switched on]. At the moment it's humming faintly[end if]."</div>
</div>

<p>If you want the on/off state to not be mentioned with respect to only
one device, unlisting the examine devices rule is like unscrewing a
screw with a shovel. Instead, do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The examine devices rule does nothing when the noun is the electric razor.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The examine devices rule does nothing when the noun is the electric razor.</div>
</div>

<p>(Note: This procedure only works from 6L02 onward; if you’re using an
older version of Inform, you’re on your own.) Another odd thing about
Inform’s default implementation of devices &ndash; well, let’s stick with the
electric razor for a minute. The command SWITCH RAZOR means the same
thing as SWITCH RAZOR ON. I personally prefer to have the command SWITCH
RAZOR operate as a toggle: Giving the command when the razor is off
should turn it on, and giving the command when the razor is on should
turn it off. I managed to figure out one way to do this, and then Emily
Short suggested a better way. In the interest of providing a more
complete tutorial, let’s look at them both.</p>

<p>My method requires a side trip to <a href="../WI_17.html#section3">WI 17.3: Overriding existing commands</a>, where
you’ll learn how to detach the word “switch” from the switching on
action.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand the command &quot;switch&quot; as something new.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand the command "switch" as something new.</div>
</div>

<p>The tricky thing is, when we do this, SWITCH ON and SWITCH OFF won’t
work either, because we’ve detached the word “switch” from <em>all</em>
commands. So in addition to creating a new action (which we’ll call
toggling), we also have to replace the grammar for SWITCH that we want
to work the way it did before.</p>

<p>Here’s the final version of my code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand the command &quot;switch&quot; as something new.\nUnderstand &quot;switch [something] on&quot; and &quot;switch on [something]&quot; as switching on.\nUnderstand &quot;switch [something] off&quot; and &quot;switch off [something]&quot; as switching off.\n\nToggling is an action applying to one thing and requiring light. Understand &quot;toggle [something]&quot; and &quot;switch [something]&quot; as toggling.\n\nCheck toggling:\n\tif the noun is not a device:\n\t\tsay &quot;[The noun] can&apos;t be toggled on and off.&quot;\n\nCarry out toggling:\n\tif the noun is switched on:\n\t\ttry switching off the noun instead;\n\totherwise:\n\t\ttry switching on the noun instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand the command "switch" as something new.</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "switch [something] on" and "switch on [something]" as switching on.</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "switch [something] off" and "switch off [something]" as switching off.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Toggling is an action applying to one thing and requiring light. Understand "toggle [something]" and "switch [something]" as toggling.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check toggling:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is not a device:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] can't be toggled on and off."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out toggling:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is switched on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try switching off the noun instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try switching on the noun instead.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the command SWITCH RAZOR will alternately switch the razor on and
off.</p>

<p>Emily’s method is much simpler, and illustrates a cool feature of
Inform programming:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;switch [a switched on thing]&quot; as switching off.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "switch [a switched on thing]" as switching off.</div>
</div>

<p>That’s it &ndash; that’s the whole answer. Emily explains it this way:
“Because ‘a switched on thing’ is more specific than ‘a thing’, this
understand line will be sorted early in the parse list and will be
matched first if it applies [to the player’s input]. Switched off things
will continue to be caught by the existing understand line. The clever
use of adjectives in understand tokens is a useful technique to have in
one’s Inform programming repertoire. It’s possible to tuck some
complicated logic into the parser without having to write a separate
action for each possible variation.”</p>

<p>The default response when a device is switched on or off is this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>switch on razor</div>

<p>You switch the electric razor on.</p>
</div>

<p>This is functional, but with some devices, we might want something
more descriptive. If you simply write a “Report switching on” rule for
your device, it will run &ndash; and then the standard report switching on
rule in the library will run, resulting in a double output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>switch on razor</div>
<p>The razor begins humming faintly.</p>
<p>You switch the electric razor on.</p>
</div>

<p>This is obviously undesirable. Here’s how to get rid of it for a
specific device:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Report an actor switching on (this is the new report switching on rule):\n\tif the action is not silent:\n\t\tif the noun is the razor:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;The razor begins humming faintly.&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;[The actor] [switch] [the noun] on.&quot; (A).\n\nThe new report switching on rule is listed instead of the standard report switching on rule in the report switching on rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Report an actor switching on (this is the new report switching on rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the action is not silent:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The razor begins humming faintly.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The actor] [switch] [the noun] on." (A).</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The new report switching on rule is listed instead of the standard report switching on rule in the report switching on rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>With this code in place, your own report for the action of switching
on the razor will be the only output displayed in response to the
action.</p>

<p>Creating buttons that can be pushed and levers that can be pulled is
almost too simple to be worth mentioning:</p>

<p><a href="../examples/safety.html">Example 298: Safety</a>, shows how to make a
spinning dial on a safe, but the example is hardly complete. For one
thing, the dial doesn’t exist as a separate object that can be examined.
And because it can’t be examined, there’s no way to find out what number
it’s currently set to. A question on the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction
(back when it was still used as a forum for IF discussion, before

<p>Combining this code with Example 298 would require a little more
work. In a real game, you might want to create three dials of this type,
and mount them side by side on the door of the safe. This would force
the player to figure out what three-digit number to dial. You might also
want to write some code that would interpret DIAL 123 as a command to
set the first dial to 1, the second dial to 2, and so on. I’ll leave
this as an exercise for you to try on your own. The main things to
notice about the code given above are:</p>

<ol class="num">
<li>
A new action, setting the state of it to, can be used to SET DIAL TO
3 (or any other number between 1 and the max setting of the dial).</li>
<li>The command TURN DIAL will increment (add 1 to) the setting of the
dial.</li>
<li>If the dial is already at its max setting, TURN DIAL will rotate it
around to 1 again.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Many other kinds of mechanical contrivances might be useful in your
game. If you want to create a tricycle that the player can ride, for
instance, you’ll want to look at the extension called Rideable Vehicles
by Graham Nelson, which is now built into Inform. In Appendix C of this
<em>Handbook,</em> you’ll find an example of a device (the “Omega
Machine”) that will respond to commands.</p>

<h3 id="smelling-listening">Smelling &amp; Listening</h3>

<p>Inform includes the commands “smell [something]” and “listen to
[something]”, but they don’t do anything. The output is “You smell
nothing unexpected” or “You hear nothing unexpected.”</p>

<p>An important part of writing good fiction (of any kind, not just
interactive fiction) is letting your readers use all of their senses.
Adding an odor or sound to a single object with an Instead rule is
easy:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of smelling the garbage:\n\tsay &quot;It smells awful!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of smelling the garbage:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It smells awful!"</div>
</div>

<p>This will work if the player types SMELL GARBAGE. But the player
might just type SMELL. As explained on <a href="../WI_7.html#section7">WI 7.7: the other four senses</a>, this command is
redirected to smelling the location (the room) &ndash; and again, by default,
the game replies, “You smell nothing unexpected.” If the garbage is in
the location, this response is just plain wrong. If the garbage is fixed
in place, we can give the room an Instead rule so that it will respond
to the SMELL command:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of smelling the Alley:\n\tsay &quot;It smells of garbage.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of smelling the Alley:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It smells of garbage."</div>
</div>

<p>But we’ll have to do that for every room where there’s an odor, and
if some of the things that have odors are getting moved around during
the game, keeping track of them in order to list the odors will get
messy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it’s not hard to improve Inform’s handling of smelling
and listening. The <em>Recipe Book</em> provides several good examples
of ways to add sounds to a game, so in the <em>Handbook</em> we’ll
concentrate on odors. In the code below, we’re going to give every thing
in the game a scent (which is a text in quotes). By default, this text
will be empty. But now we can add a scent as a property of a thing,
rather than needing to write a whole new Instead rule. A single Instead
rule (Instead of smelling something) will handle any object the player
tries to SMELL.</p>

<p>The other feature we’ll add is this: We’ll define a thing as smelly
if its scent is not “” (that is, when the scent property is not empty).
When there is something smelly in the room, typing SMELL will list the
smelly things in the room.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing has some text called the scent.\n\nDefinition: A thing (called the odor-bearer) is smelly if the scent of the odor-bearer is not &quot;&quot;.\n\nInstead of smelling something:\n\tif the noun is smelly:\n\t\tsay &quot;[scent of the noun][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\totherwise if the noun is the player:\n\t\tsay &quot;You don&apos;t smell too sweaty today.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;It smells like an ordinary [noun].&quot;\n\nInstead of smelling a room:\n\tlet L be the list of smelly things enclosed by the location;\n\tif L is empty: \n\t\tsay &quot;You smell nothing unexpected.&quot;; \n\totherwise: \n\t\tsay &quot;You smell [a list of smelly things enclosed by the location].&quot; \n\nThe Kitchen is a room.\nThe banana is in the Kitchen.

<p>There are other ways to implement smelling. This is normal in writing
interactive fiction &ndash; the author can usually solve the same problem by
using several different techniques. Below is a simple example game that
I’ve adapted from an example uploaded to the <a
href="https://ifwiki.org/">IF Wiki</a>). It differs
from the code shown above in a number of ways.</p>

<p>First, it implements the smelling action in a more complete way.
Because it uses Carry Out and Report rules rather than Instead rules, it
has to start by removing the block smelling rule from the Standard
Rules. Second, it gives distinct odors to rooms rather than just listing
any smelly objects that are in the room. Third, it has the beginnings of
a puzzle, in the form of a spacesuit that will block smelling. Fourth,
the odor of the sewage is so powerful that it will prevent you from
smelling the flower.</p>

<p>In passing, you might want to take note of the lists of conditions in
those last two Instead rules. This syntax is not used much in the
<em>Handbook,</em> but it’s good to know about it.</p>

<h3 id="transforming-one-thing-into-another">Transforming One Thing into Another</h3>

<p>In a game that includes magic, you might want to turn an object into
another object. (Maybe this would happen when you cast a spell on the
object using my Spellcasting extension.) The easy way to do this in
Inform is to create both objects but leave one of them offstage at the
beginning of the game. When it’s time to transform the object, simply
whisk it offstage and replace it with the other object. Here’s the
classic story situation, more or less:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Creekside is a room. &quot;A burbling creek runs through the forest here.&quot;\n\nThe toad is an animal in the Creekside. &quot;An ugly, warty toad squats on a rock near the creek.&quot; The description is &quot;He&apos;s ugly and green.&quot; Understand &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;green&quot; as the toad.\n\nThe princess is a woman. &quot;A beautiful princess stands before you!&quot; The description is &quot;She&apos;s the most beautiful woman you&apos;ve ever seen.&quot; Understand &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; as the princess.\n\nInstead of kissing the toad:\n\tnow the princess is in the location of the toad;\n\tnow the toad is nowhere;\n\tsay &quot;As your lips touch the ugly toad, it shimmers and sparkles and turns into a beautiful princess. &apos;My goodness,&apos; the princess declares. &apos;Thank you!&apos;&quot;\n\nInstead of kissing the princess:\n\tsay &quot;The princess smiles modestly and pushes you away. &apos;Maybe later,&apos; she suggests. &apos;After we get to know one another better.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Creekside is a room. "A burbling creek runs through the forest here."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The toad is an animal in the Creekside. "An ugly, warty toad squats on a rock near the creek." The description is "He's ugly and green." Understand "ugly" and "green" as the toad.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The princess is a woman. "A beautiful princess stands before you!" The description is "She's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen." Understand "beautiful" and "woman" as the princess.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of kissing the toad:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the princess is in the location of the toad;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the toad is nowhere;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "As your lips touch the ugly toad, it shimmers and sparkles and turns into a beautiful princess. 'My goodness,' the princess declares. 'Thank you!'"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of kissing the princess:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The princess smiles modestly and pushes you away. 'Maybe later,' she suggests. 'After we get to know one another better.'"</div>
</div>

<p>Initially the princess is nowhere. The Instead rule does three
things. First, it makes a note about where the toad is. This is a good
idea, because in a real game the toad might be moving around, and it
would be a bug if you kiss the toad in the throne room and have the
princess pop up back at the creekside. Then the rule gets rid of the
toad and moves the princess to the room where the toad was.</p>

<p>If we’re transforming one inanimate object into another, we’ll want
to do it just a bit differently, because an inanimate object might be on
a supporter or in a container. If you’re transforming a gold crown into
an old shoe, for instance, and if the crown is on a table, you don’t
want the shoe to appear on the floor of the room &ndash; you want it to show
up on the table. To take care of this, we need to refer to “the holder”
of the crown. The holder will always be the crown’s immediate
location:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of casting shazam at the crown:\n\tnow the old shoe is in the holder of the crown;\n\tremove the crown from play;\n\tsay &quot;The crown emits an unhappy crinkling, shriveling sort of noise, and turns into an old shoe.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of casting shazam at the crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the old shoe is in the holder of the crown;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;remove the crown from play;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The crown emits an unhappy crinkling, shriveling sort of noise, and turns into an old shoe."</div>
</div>

<h3 id="new-ways-to-use-things">New Ways to Use Things</h3>

<p>Inform’s model of how things exist (and can be used) in the world is
very simple. Sometimes you’ll want the player to be able to do something
new or unexpected with a thing. In this section we’ll borrow some ideas
from Chapter 4, “Actions,” and show you how to allow new kinds of
actions with the objects in your game. For details on how Check, Carry
Out, Report, and Instead rules work, consult Chapter 4. The main purpose
of the section you’re now reading is to show how to do interesting
things with the new objects you’ve created.</p>

<p>This section was inspired by an old post on rec.arts.int-fiction,
which I spotted while poking around in the <a
href="https://ifwiki.org/">IF Wiki</a>). The list of
new actions suggested by Jan Thorsby in that post was short but
suggestive: holding an object close to or against another object,
holding an object up in the air, threatening an NPC with an object, or
tipping a bookshelf forward so that the thing on the top shelf will fall
down. I’ll leave you to explore the process of threatening an NPC for
yourself. The other three actions are illustrated below.</p>

<p>The number of new things you might want players to be able to do is
probably infinite. Some of them will turn out to be easy to set up;
others may be surprisingly tricky for you to implement. The key, in each
case, is to think logically and try to handle all of the things a player
might do. You’ll also need to consider all of the states that your
objects might get themselves into. For example, you may know that you
only want your new tipping action to apply to one object in the game &ndash;
but once players know that the TIP command works, they’ll surely try it
on anything and everything. So you need to write a check rule for your
new action that will handle any and all of players’ attempts with a
sensible-sounding refusal message. You may also want to write an in-game
clue to suggest that tipping something might be a good action to try.
For instance, in a description of an object: “It looks as if it might
tip over in a strong breeze.”</p>

<h4 id="holding-something-up-in-the-air">Holding Something Up in the Air</h4>

<p>The player might very reasonably want to hold an object up in the air
so as to make it visible to an NPC who is far away. (If the NPC is in
the same room, a standard command of the form SHOW JEWEL TO PRINCESS
should do the job.) You might want to hold up a white sheet, for
instance, if you’re marooned on an island and trying to attract the
attention of a passing ship. Below is a simple example game that
implements this action. Notice the long list of input grammar that is
allowed. You’d probably want to add even more grammar lines to this list
if you’re using this action in a game.</p>

<p>The key point in this example is that the sheet has to be held aloft
for three consecutive turns on the beach in order to signal the passing
ship. If the player drops the sheet or walks west into the jungle, the
sheet is no longer aloft, and the count drops back to zero. Taking care
of details like these will add realism to your game.</p>

<p>The details are taken care of by the after dropping something and
after going rules, and by the new property called aloft. Every object in
the game can be aloft or not &ndash; but most of them won’t be, so this new
property will only be useful in a few cases.</p>

<p>Why make aloft a general property of all things, when you’re only
going to be using it for one object? Because it reduces the chance of
bugs, and makes your code easier to maintain and expand. If you should
later be writing a different section and decide that the player needs to
hold a torch aloft, you don’t have to go back and revise anything,
because the torch already has that property.</p>

<p>Placing an object out of reach &ndash; on a high shelf or down at the

rocked or tipped. In the example below, note that the pushing action

<h4 id="holding-something-against-something-else">Holding Something Against Something Else</h4>

<p>This example creates a new action, holding it against. This action
has two Report rules. The thing you need to know is that when your game
is being compiled, Inform assembles all of the rules, including those in
the standard library, those in any extensions you have included, and any
you have written yourself, into rulebooks. <em>Both</em> of our new
rules will end up in the report holding it against rulebook &ndash; but Inform
has some very specific criteria (let’s not call them rules, as that
would be confusing) about how to do this. It puts more specific rules
near the top of the rulebook, and more general rules later in the
rulebook.</p>

<p>As a result, the Report holding the stethoscope against the wall rule
will be earlier in the “report holding it against” rulebook. When this
rulebook is being consulted (after the player has used the command HOLD
STETHOSCOPE AGAINST WALL, for instance), Inform will consult the
rulebook <em>until one of the rules makes a decision</em>. Then it will
stop. For this reason, we’ll end the specific rule with the line “rule
succeeds.” This will prevent the more general rule from being
applied.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-actions">Chapter 4: Actions</h2>

<p>An action is what happens within the game when the player types a
command. Inform provides a bunch of built-in actions, but before long
you’ll probably want to modify the built-in actions, or create some new
ones. <a href="../WI_12.html#section7">WI 12.7: New
actions</a> begins: “It is not often that we need to create new
actions&hellip;”. In my own experience writing games, this is simply not
true. Inform’s built-in actions handle many of the basic types of
commands that the player may want to use, but many equally common
actions are not included. Soon after I add a few objects to a new game,
I begin to realize that the player may want to try all sorts of odd
commands with the objects. Even if I only want to give the player an
interesting “you can’t do that” message, I still need to create a new
action.</p>

<p>As a general rule, you should try to anticipate <em>all</em> of the
command words that your players may think to try, and write code to
handle them. Your beta-testers will be a great source of feedback on
this point: If you read the game transcripts they send you, you’ll
probably spot a dozen or more synonyms for actions that you have
implemented, plus an assortment of plausible actions that you may want
to add. Some of these might even suggest alternate solutions to your
puzzles. Adding a few alternate solutions is not just a courtesy to
players: It also deepens and enriches the model world of your game.</p>

<h3 id="built-in-actions">Built-In Actions</h3>

<p>From the moment you start writing your first interactive story,
you’ll be able to use a handy set of actions that are built into Inform.
To see the list of built-in actions, open up your game (or create a new
game and add as little as a single room) and click the Go button. After
the game compiles successfully, go to the Index tab and click on the
Actions header. You’ll find a list of about 50 actions (see next
page).</p>

<p>With no extra effort on your part, the player will be able to move
from place to place, examine objects, pick them up, take inventory, drop
objects that are being carried, put objects on top of supporters or in
containers, open and close doors, wear and remove clothing, unlock or
lock things that are locked, and so on.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/action_index.jpg"></div>

<p>If you click on the gray magnifying-glass button next to an action in
the Actions Index, a page will open up in which you’ll learn more about
that action. On the page describing an action, you’ll see a list of
typed commands that can cause the action to happen and a list of rules
that can affect the outcome after the action starts. This page may not
list all of the exact synonyms. But there are several ways to figure out
what actions are being generated by a given command word.</p>

<p>First, the SHOWVERB debugging command can be used in the game to
display a list of the Inform 6 grammar lines that cause the action to
happen. (For more on the relationship between Inform 6 and Inform 7, see
<a href="#what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What Does Inform 6 Have to Do with Inform 7?</a>.)
Here, for instance, is the output for the drop action:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>showverb drop</div>

<p>Verb 'discard' 'drop' 'throw'</p>

<p>* multiheld -&gt; Drop</p>

<p>* held 'at' / 'against' / 'on' / 'onto' noun -&gt; ThrowAt</p>

<p>* multiexcept 'in' / 'into' / 'down' noun -&gt; Insert</p>

<p>* multiexcept 'on' / 'onto' noun -&gt; PutOn</p>
</div>

<p>Don’t worry too much about the picky details of that output. (Inform
6 programmers will understand it at a glance.) The main point is that
'discard', 'drop', and 'throw' are all synonyms for an action &ndash; and all
three words can lead to any of four different actions (Drop, ThrowAt,
Insert, or PutOn). These action names are I6 code, not I7 &ndash; an important
distinction. The I6 Insert action is invoked in I7 code using the phrase
“inserting [it] into.”</p>

<p>Second, if you scroll down on the Actions page or click the red Cm
button, you’ll find an alphabetical list of commands that are available
to the player. If you’re trying to find out what action(s) can be
generated by a command word, such as DISCARD, you can look it up in this
list. You’ll find that it says, “same as drop.” And the four listings
for DROP are exactly what’s shown above in the Inform 6 code: dropping,
throwing it at, inserting it into, and putting it on.</p>

<p>Another useful feature of Inform is the ACTIONS debugging command. In
debug mode only (that’s the mode you’re using as you work on your game),
giving the ACTIONS command in the game turns on some special output that
reveals more about what’s going on behind the scenes in the software.
Here’s an example of how the ACTIONS debugging command works:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p>You can see an apple here.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>actions</div>

<p>Actions listing on.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>pick up apple</div>

<p>[taking the apple]</p>

<p>Taken.</p>

<p>[taking the apple - succeeded]</p>
</div>

<p>Here we find a listing for the action (the action of <em>taking</em>
with the apple as the noun), and also an indication that the action’s
rules succeeded. Next, we’ll look at a slightly more interesting
example. Here’s the action listing in the game for an absurd action, one
that isn’t going to work:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>wear book</div>

<p>[wearing the book]</p>

<p>(first taking the book)</p>

<p>[(1) taking the book - silently]</p>

<p>[(1) taking the book - silently - succeeded]</p>

<p>You can't wear that!</p>

<p>[wearing the book - failed the can't wear what's not clothing
rule]</p>
</div>

<p>The action listing reveals two things. First, the command WEAR
triggers the <em>implicit</em> action of taking. This is because Inform
assumes that the player will need to be holding an object in order to
put it on. Second, while the action of taking the book implicitly
succeeded, the action of wearing the book failed. Inform tells us not
only that it failed, but what specific rule caused it to fail. This
information could be important if we want to replace that rule.
Replacing the rules in the Standard Library is an advanced topic,
however. It’s touched on only briefly in this <em>Handbook,</em> in
<a href="#chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10, Advanced Topics</a>.</p>

<p>One of the common sources of frustration for newcomers to Inform is
not knowing how to refer to the built-in actions in their code. One of
the most frequent problems comes from the inserting it into action.
Newcomers tend to try to refer to this action in what seems to be a
natural way, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of putting the apple in the basket:\n\tsay &quot;The basket scoots away from you!&quot; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  <div class="codeline">Instead of putting the apple in the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The basket scoots away from you!" [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>But that doesn’t work, because there is no action called “putting it
in.” Here’s the correct way to refer to this action:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of inserting the apple into the basket:\n\tsay &quot;The basket scoots away from you!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  <div class="codeline">Instead of inserting the apple into the basket:</div>
  <div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The basket scoots away from you!"</div>
</div>

<p>By using the ACTIONS command and then using a command such as PUT
APPLE IN BASKET in your game, you can see which action or actions are
being triggered.</p>

<h3 id="using-instead">Using “Instead”</h3>

<p>The easiest way to start customizing how Inform handles actions is to
write a few Instead rules. We’re going to create a bubbling beaker of
magic potion and then use a couple of Instead rules on it. Inform
already has actions for drinking and taking. The command DRINK POTION,
however, produces the output, “There’s nothing suitable to drink here,”
which is not what we want in this particular case. TAKE POTION will
allow the player to pick up the potion, and that might not be what we
want either, if the potion is a liquid in a container. Here’s how to
customize Inform’s default behavior using Instead rules:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The bubbling potion is on the stone table. The description is &quot;The bubbling beaker is full of noxious-looking yellow potion.&quot; Understand &quot;beaker&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;noxious&quot; as the bubbling potion.\n\nInstead of drinking the bubbling potion:\n\tsay &quot;You take a tiny sip, but it smells awful, so you put it down again.&quot;\n\nInstead of taking the bubbling potion:\n\tsay &quot;If you try to carry it around, you&apos;ll only spill it and stain your clothes.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The bubbling potion is on the stone table. The description is "The bubbling beaker is full of noxious-looking yellow potion." Understand "beaker", "yellow", and "noxious" as the bubbling potion.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of drinking the bubbling potion:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You take a tiny sip, but it smells awful, so you put it down again."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the bubbling potion:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "If you try to carry it around, you'll only spill it and stain your clothes."</div>
</div>

<p>The response above to TAKE POTION will prevent the player from
picking up the potion, because the Instead rule will stop the taking
action in its tracks. We could do the same thing by saying, “The
bubbling potion is fixed in place”, but that produces a boring message
when the player tries TAKE POTION. The code above will give a more
interesting message.</p>

<p>Likewise, if the player tries DRINK POTION, a new message will be
printed out by the Instead rule in place of the default message. Nothing
will actually happen in the model world as a result of this command &ndash;
but if we wanted something to happen, we could just add it to the
Instead rule. In an extreme case, we might want to do something like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of drinking the bubbling potion:\n\tsay &quot;Your first tiny sip of the bubbling potion causes your whole body to be wracked by horrible spasms!&quot;;\n\tend the story saying &quot;How inconvenient. You have died!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of drinking the bubbling potion:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Your first tiny sip of the bubbling potion causes your whole body to be wracked by horrible spasms!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying "How inconvenient. You have died!"</div>
</div>

<p>Almost anything we might want to happen in the model world can be
tucked into an Instead rule like this. To understand how Instead rules
work, we need to delve deeper into Inform’s action processing.</p>

<h3 id="action-processing">Action Processing</h3>

<p><a href="WI_12.html#section2">WI 12.2: How
actions are processed</a> has a diagram (a flowchart) that shows &ndash; as you
might expect &ndash; how actions are processed. The first time I looked at
this diagram, it baffled me, but it really does make sense. (See <a
href="#action-processing-summary">Action Processing Summary</a> for a detailed run-through of
this diagram).</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/action_rulebooks.png"></div>

<p>When the player types a command, the game goes through a number of
steps. First it makes sure it knows what the input words are, and that
the command makes grammatical sense. (This step isn’t in the diagram.)
If there’s a typo in the input &ndash; or even if the parser knows all of the
individual words but doesn’t understand how they’re strung together &ndash;
the parser will reject the input before anything happens. Assuming the
parser can figure out what the words are, and that they’re in a
grammatical form that the parser knows, Inform starts processing the
action.</p>

<p>The first step shown in the diagram is Inform looking to see if there
is a Before rule that might affect the action. But in fact there’s a
step before this, which is also not shown in the diagram. If the action
includes a noun, as most actions do &ndash; PICK UP THE APPLE, for instance &ndash;
the game first checks to make sure that there’s an object in the room
that can be referred to as “apple.” If the apple is in a different room,
it’s not in scope. <a
href="#Ref_scope">Scope checking</a> is one of the most
important things the parser does, and it happens <em>before</em> the
Before rules are considered.</p>

<p>There’s an exception to this, as we’ll see in the section below on
“[Any Thing]”. Inform also provides a way to add distant objects to
scope. This can be useful, for example, when a large open area is
defined in your code as several separate rooms. The player will expect
to be able to see the beach ball after dropping it at the north end of
the field, even when the player has moved off to the south end of the
field. (“Indoors &amp; Outdoors” in Appendix C shows one way to do
this.)</p>

<p>It’s easy to write your own Before rules for existing actions &ndash; but
it’s also easy to create odd bugs with Before rules. While first
learning to use Inform, you should probably stick with Instead rules
when you need to alter the processing of a built-in action. As the
diagram in 12.2 shows, <em>after</em> the Before rules are considered,
Inform pauses to figure out whether the objects being referred to are
actually available for action processing &ndash; whether they can be touched.
This is a narrower question than the question of whether an object is in
scope. If an object is in a transparent container in the room, for
instance, and if the container is closed and locked, the player can see
what’s in the container, so objects in the container are in scope, and
can be examined. (The action of examining is considered to be visually
based, so you should avoid mentioning how objects feel or smell when
writing their descriptions.) But the objects in the closed transparent
container can’t actually be touched or taken.</p>

<p>Here’s the essential point: While the Before rules are being
considered, Inform doesn’t yet know that the glass container is closed
and locked! Here’s an example of a Before rule that may look sensible at
first glance, but that will get you in trouble:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The glass case is an openable lockable transparent container in the Lab. The glass case is closed and locked.\n\nAn apple is in the glass case. A wicker basket is an open container in the Lab.\n\nBefore taking the apple:\n\tif the player does not carry the apple:\n\t\tif the player carries the basket:\n\t\t\tif the apple is not in the basket:\n\t\t\t\tnow the apple is in the basket;\n\t\t\t\tsay &quot;You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.&quot;;\n\t\t\t\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The glass case is an openable lockable transparent container in the Lab. The glass case is closed and locked.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">An apple is in the glass case. A wicker basket is an open container in the Lab.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before taking the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player carries the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the apple is not in the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the apple is in the basket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>The author of this code might be trying to save the player a little
work, by putting the apple into the basket automatically in response to
the command TAKE APPLE. But can you see what’s going to happen? The
Before rule tests several things, but it doesn’t test to make sure the
apple is actually available for taking. And Inform doesn’t yet know that
either, because the test for availability won’t be run until
<em>after</em> the Before rule is considered. The result is a bug &ndash; a
player who is carrying the basket can get the apple out of the glass
case without unlocking or opening the case!</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take apple</div>

<p>The glass case isn't open.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take basket</div>

<p>Taken.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take apple</div>

<p>You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>i</div>

<p>You are carrying:</p>

<p>a wicker basket</p>

<p>an apple</p>
</div>

<p>This illustrates why Before rules can be a little treacherous.
Instead rules are safer. But sometimes a Before rule will give you
better results. Consider this code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The jeweled crown is on the table. It is wearable.\n\nInstead of wearing the jeweled crown:\n\tsay &quot;The king has warned you not to touch his crown.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The jeweled crown is on the table. It is wearable.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of wearing the jeweled crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The king has warned you not to touch his crown."</div>
</div>

<p>If you use an Instead rule here, Inform will perform an implicit
taking action, as shown earlier in this chapter. The implicit taking
action will cause the player to pick up the crown before refusing to
allow it to be worn. This happens because Inform assumes that things can
only be donned while they’re being held. (In the original version of the
<em>Handbook</em>, this example referred to the eating action, but I7
has been revised so that things can more easily be eaten without first
being picked up. The details are a bit convoluted, but now the implicit
taking of a portable edible thing happens in a Check rule, not in a
Before rule.)</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>wear crown</div>
<p>
(first taking the jeweled crown)</p>
<p>
The king has warned you not to touch his crown.</p>
<p>
&gt;i</p>
<p>
You are carrying:</p>
<p>
a jeweled crown</p>
</div>

<p>A Before rule will run before the implicit take action happens, so
the player won’t automatically pick up the cake before changing her mind
about eating it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before wearing the jeweled crown:\n\tsay &quot;The king has warned you not to touch his crown.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before wearing the jeweled crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The king has warned you not to touch his crown." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>Note the use of the word “instead” at the end of the Before rule
above. This may look odd, since we’re writing a Before rule, not an
Instead rule, but it’s a convenient syntax. In this case, what “instead”
does is cause the Before rule to succeed (see “Rulebooks &amp; ‘Stop the
Action’,” below), thus shutting off any further processing of the
player’s command. If you forget to add “instead”, a Before rule
<em>doesn’t</em> shut off the action processing. The action will
continue.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t make sense yet, keep reading. It will start to make
sense &ndash; and it’s important.</p>

<p>For technical reasons, there’s only one Before rulebook and one
Instead rulebook. As an action is being processed, Inform will run
through these rulebooks looking for rules that might apply. Any rule
that applies might end with a “rule succeeds” line, which will shut off
any further processing. If none of the Before rules that Inform thinks
might apply ends with a “rule succeeds” or “rule fails” (which in this
case is pretty much the same thing) or an “instead” (which is equivalent
to “rule succeeds”), Inform proceeds to the Instead rulebook, and then
to the Check rulebook for the specific action. Each action has its own
Check, Carry Out, and Report rules. Before the Report rules for the
action are considered, though, Inform dips into the After rulebook
(again, there’s only one, though it might contain dozens of rules
applying to different actions). This is what <a href="WI_12.html#section2">WI 12.2</a>'s action processing diagram is illustrating. If no After rule shuts off the action
processing, the Report rules for the current action will be
considered.</p>

<p>This cycle &ndash; Check, Carry Out, Report &ndash; is the nuts and bolts of how
Inform processes actions. They’re what happens with built-in actions
that are defined in the standard library. Before, Instead, and After are
mostly for the author to use, though Inform has some built-in Before
rules. You can also write your own Check, Carry Out, and Report rules,
as we’ll see later in this chapter.</p>

<p>In a Check rule, Inform checks whether the action makes sense. The
eating action (built-in) gives a good example of the use of a Check
rule. If you haven’t told Inform that an object is edible, when the
player tries to EAT it, the “can’t eat unless edible rule,” which is a
Check rule for the eating action, will print out the message “That’s
plainly inedible.” This rule will then fail (it ends with the line “rule
fails”), which will stop Inform from going on to the Carry Out rulebook
for the eating action.</p>

<p>If no Check rule gets in the way, the Carry Out rules will run next.
The purpose of a Carry Out rule is to change the model world in whatever
way is needed. In the case of the eating action, for instance, the Carry
Out rule removes the edible object from play &ndash; because, obviously, it
has just been eaten. Finally (unless an After rule has gotten in the
way), the Report rule for the action will tell the player what has
happened.</p>

<p>If we use the RULES debugging command to turn on reporting of rules,
and then EAT something that we’ve declared as edible, we’ll see exactly
which rules are running:</p>
</div>
  <div class="game-output">
    <div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>eat apple</div>

<p>[Rule "declare everything initially unmentioned rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "announce items from multiple object lists rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "set pronouns from items from multiple object lists rule"
applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "before stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "instead stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "investigate player's awareness before action rule"
applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "player aware of his own actions rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "check stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "can't eat unless edible rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "can't eat clothing without removing it first rule"
applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "can't eat other people's food rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "can't eat portable food without carrying it rule"
applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "carry out stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "standard eating rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "after stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "investigate player's awareness after action rule"
applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "report stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "standard report eating rule" applies.]</p>

<p>You eat the apple. Not bad.</p>

<p>[Rule "last specific action-processing rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "A first turn sequence rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "every turn stage rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "A last turn sequence rule" applies.]</p>

<p>[Rule "notify score changes rule" applies.]</p>
  </div>
  
<p>This rather intimidating list of rules is quite a bit longer than it
was in earlier versions of Inform, because Inform is more careful than
it used to be in its attempts to produce a realistic world model. On
scanning the output above, you may think it’s odd at first that the
“can’t eat clothing without removing it first rule” applies, since the
apple is not clothing &ndash; but in this situation, “applies” doesn’t mean
that the rule did anything. (The fact that Inform understands the
concept of edible clothing is a little bizarre, but we won’t worry about
that.) All that’s happening during the processing of this command is
that Inform is <em>consulting</em> those rules and then rejecting them.
The result of the “standard eating rule” (a Carry Out rule) is that the
apple is removed from the model world. It’s gone, because the player has
eaten it. The “standard report eating rule,” a Report rule, then tells
the player what has happened.</p>

<p>There are several ways for the author to get in and alter Inform’s
action processing. You’ve already seen a couple of examples. For more,
see the section on “Altered Actions,” below. Before we get to that,
let’s take a closer look at how action processing rulebooks work.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="efficiency-tip">
<h4>Efficiency Tip</h4>

<p>If you’re writing a game that may be played on an interpreter that
runs in a Web browser or on a hand-held device (which pretty much means,
if you’re writing an Inform game at all), you should avoid using
Instead, Before, and After rules when possible. Use Check, Carry Out,
and Report instead. As Inform guru Ron Newcomb has pointed out, an
Inform game consults <em>all</em> of the Before rules you’ve written as
it processes <em>every</em> command from the player. If a Before rule
doesn’t stop the action processing, all of the Instead rules must then
be considered. Depending on how many of these rules you’ve written, the
game may become sluggish when played on a slow interpreter. For more on
this topic, see <a href="#code-optimization">Code Optimization</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="rulebooks-stop-the-action">Rulebooks &amp; “Stop the Action”</h3>

<p>When a game is running, Inform processes actions using
<strong>rulebooks</strong>. A rulebook is, as you might guess, a
collection of rules. You can create your own rulebooks for any purpose
at all if you want to, but that’s an advanced programming concept, and
it isn’t covered in this <em>Handbook</em>. For many games, you won’t
need to. The rulebooks built into Inform can handle most types of
action.</p>

<p>When your game is compiled, all of the Before rules &ndash; in your own
code, in Inform’s built-in library, and in any extensions that you’re
using &ndash; are packed into the Before rulebook. Likewise, all of the
Instead rules are packed into an Instead rulebook. (For now, we’re not
going to get into the question of how Inform decides what order to put
the rules in. If you want to know more about this, you can read
<a href="../WI_19.html">Chapter 19 of <em>Writing with Inform</em>,
“Rulebooks”</a>.) And all of the After rules are in a single After rulebook.
But each action (for example, taking, looking, and going) has its own
Check, Carry Out, and Report rulebooks.</p>

<p>Every rule in every rulebook ends in one of three ways: success,
failure, or no decision. As an action is being processed, Inform runs
through the rulebooks &ndash; Before, Instead, Check, Carry Out, After, and
Report &ndash; consulting all of the rules in the order that they’re listed in
the rulebook. It goes through the rules <em>until one of the rules ends
in success or failure</em>. At that point, Inform knows that the action
has been handled, and it stops.</p>

<p>Every rulebook has a <em>default outcome</em> for the rules that are
in the rulebook. This is one of the key concepts in Inform authorship.
If you write a new Instead, Before, After, Check, Carry Out, or Report
rule and don’t tell Inform what outcome your specific new rule will
have, it will use the default outcome for that rulebook. This is
important, because it affects how you write new rules.</p>

<p>The default for the Before, Check, and Carry Out rulebooks is to make
no decision. So if you write a Before rule and don’t tell Inform that
the rule has succeeded or failed, Inform will look at your rule, do
whatever it says to do, and then go right on processing the action. The
After rulebook, however, has a default of success, and the Instead
rulebook has a default of failure. So when you write a new Instead or
After rule, if you don’t say otherwise, your rule will cause action
processing to stop.</p>

<p>The phrase “continue the action” is one of the first phrases I
learned when I started writing new rules. It means exactly the same
thing as “make no decision”. You can use either of these two phrases.
Here’s a simple example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the live wire:\n\tif the player does not wear the insulated gloves:\n\t\tend the story saying “You have been electrocuted!”;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the live wire:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not wear the insulated gloves:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “You have been electrocuted!”;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>If the player is not wearing the insulated gloves, the outcome of the
Instead rule will be failure (though in this case it hardly matters, as
the game-ending rules will take over). If the player <em>is</em> wearing
the gloves, this Instead rule will make no decision, and action
processing will continue &ndash; most likely with the rules in the Check
Taking rulebook. (Since the live wire is probably attached to something
at its other end, and thus can’t be carried around, this example doesn’t
actually make a lot of sense, but we’ll ignore that.)</p>

<p>The opposite of “continue the action” is “stop the action”. I’ve been
in the habit of using this &ndash; but I’m going to have to get out of the
habit. Most of the time, it works just fine, but once in a while it can
get you in trouble. Let’s look at why.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple game, for testing, that shows what can happen. I like
putting a red button in the room in a test game so that I can test
anything I like using the command PUSH BUTTON. In a real game, the rule
shown below for taking the sponge would be more complex; there’s no need
to ever do it as shown here. But the result (when the game is being
played) might be similar to what you’re seeing if you have a mysterious
bug in your code.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Lounge is a room.\n\nA sponge is in the Lounge. A red button is in the Lounge.\n\nBefore taking the sponge:\n\tnow the player carries the sponge;\n\tsay &quot;You grab the sponge.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n\t[stop the action.]\n\nInstead of pushing the red button:\n\tif we have taken the sponge:\n\t\tsay &quot;Yep -- you took the sponge.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;Nope -- you never took the sponge.&quot;\n\ntest me with &quot;take sponge / i / press red button&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Lounge is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A sponge is in the Lounge. A red button is in the Lounge.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before taking the sponge:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the sponge;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You grab the sponge.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[stop the action.]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of pushing the red button:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if we have taken the sponge:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Yep -- you took the sponge.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Nope -- you never took the sponge."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">test me with "take sponge / i / press red button"</div>
</div>

<p>For technical reasons, it’s necessary to test using the odd phrase
“we have taken the sponge”. Testing “if the player has taken the sponge”
won’t compile. But the point is this: If the Before rule (“Before taking
the sponge”) ends with “rule succeeds”, as shown above, running the test
by typing TEST ME will reveal that we have indeed taken the sponge. On
the other hand, if you comment out “rule succeeds.” (by putting square
brackets around it) and uncomment “stop the action.” (by removing the
brackets), when you run TEST ME you’ll see that apparently the player
has <em>not</em> taken the sponge, even though it’s now in the player’s
inventory.</p>

<p>That, in a nutshell, is why using “stop the action” is a bad idea.
When you use “rule succeeds” or “rule fails” Inform does a little
housekeeping behind the scenes. In this case, the housekeeping includes
making note of the fact that the sponge has been taken. If you use “stop
the action” the housekeeping never happens, so Inform’s record-keeping
will include a mistake.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? Here’s another quick example.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Meadow is a room.\n\nThe unicorn is an animal in the Meadow. The unicorn can be angry.

<div class="codeline">The unicorn is an animal in the Meadow. The unicorn can be angry. The unicorn is not angry. The description of the unicorn is "The unicorn is [if angry]stamping his hooves and brandishing his wickedly sharp horn at Steve[else]peacefully cropping daisies[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Steve is a man in the Meadow.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A pitchfork is in the Meadow. Understand "fork" as the pitchfork.</div>

<div class="codeline">Persuasion rule for asking Steve to try taking the pitchfork:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the unicorn is angry;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Steve scoops up the pitchfork. This evidently makes the unicorn very uneasy."</div>
</div>

<p>If all we want is for Steve to pick up the pitchfork, we don’t need
an Instead rule. The Persuasion rule will cause him to carry out the
action. In this example I’ve added a line about an imaginary unicorn,
because it’s a quick example of why you might want to use an Instead
rule rather than letting the standard library handle Steve’s action. The
code seems very straightforward, but there’s a problem. Inform thinks
that the action of Steve taking the sponge <em>failed,</em> because
failure is the default outcome of the Instead rulebook. Here’s the
output in the game:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span><strong>steve, take the pitchfork</strong></div>

<p>Steve scoops up the pitchfork. This evidently makes the unicorn very
uneasy.</p>

<p>Steve is unable to do that.</p>
</div>

<p>Steve is now carrying the pitchfork, but the game has printed out an
extra message giving the player bad information. To avoid this, we need
to make sure the Instead rule succeeds:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of Steve taking the pitchfork:\n\tnow Steve carries the pitchfork;\n\tnow the unicorn is angry;\n\tsay &quot;Steve scoops up the pitchfork. This evidently makes the unicorn very uneasy.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of Steve taking the pitchfork:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now Steve carries the pitchfork;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the unicorn is angry;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Steve scoops up the pitchfork. This evidently makes the unicorn very uneasy.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>When we add “rule succeeds”, Inform knows that the action succeeded,
so no default message about the action’s failure will be printed out.
These examples show that the action processing rulebooks have default
outcomes, and that it’s important to know what the default outcomes
are.</p>

<h3 id="three-types-of-actions">Three Types of Actions</h3>

<p>We can separate actions into three main categories, depending on how
many nouns (objects) the action applies to. Some actions take no nouns,
some take one noun, and some take two. Another type of action take
<strong>topics</strong> (that is, simple text) instead of a noun. (See
<a href="#actions-with-topics">Actions with Topics</a>.)</p>

<p>Commands like SLEEP and WAIT stand by themselves. It would make no
sense at all to say SLEEP THE APPLE. Sleeping <em>on</em> or <em>in</em>
something, such as a bed, would make sense, but the command SLEEP IN BED
would trigger a different action (not the sleeping action but the
sleeping in action), and you’d have to create that action yourself,
because Inform doesn’t include it by default.</p>

<p>As this little digression should show, the same verb (in this case,
“sleep”) can trigger two or even three different actions, depending on
how the player’s input is phrased, and in particular depending on how
many nouns are used in the command.</p>

<p>Commands like PICK UP THE APPLE and BOUNCE THE BALL take one noun.
Commands like PUT APPLE IN BASKET and HIT BALL WITH STICK take two
nouns. Two nouns are the upper limit; there’s no easy way in Inform to
create a command that uses three nouns. Nor is there much reason to want
to do so. The best advice I’ve read on this subject is, “If you think
you actually need to create an action that requires three nouns … think
about it some more.”</p>

<p>A possible edge case arises in the handling of objects that can’t be
touched. For instance, you might want your game to allow a command such
as PUT RED-HOT METAL IN WATER BUCKET USING TONGS. But such a situation
can be adequately handled by implementing PICK UP METAL WITH TONGS
followed by PUT METAL IN BUCKET, using suitable new rules to make sure
that the action of inserting the red-hot metal object in the water
bucket can only happen if the metal is already in the tongs.</p>

<p>While processing the player’s command, Inform refers to the first
noun in the input simply as the noun. The second noun is referred to as
&ndash; you guessed it &ndash; the second noun. In writing our own code, we can test
the values of noun and second noun if we need to, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of inserting the apple into something:\n\tif the second noun is the basket:\n\t\tsay &quot;The basket scoots away from you!&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of inserting the apple into something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The basket scoots away from you!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>In this case, we might be better off writing an Instead rule that
simply refers to “inserting the apple into the basket”. But you’ll
sometimes find it useful to write tests such as, “if the second noun is
the basket”.</p>

<p>The second and third categories above use objects &ndash; what Inform calls
<em>things</em>. But you can’t refer to “the thing” or “the second
thing” in processing an action. The word “noun” is the tool for the
job.</p>

<h3 id="creating-new-actions">Creating New Actions</h3>

<p>To create a new action, we need to do three things:</p>

<ol class="num">
<li>
We give the action itself a name, so that we’ll be able to refer to
it in our code.</li>
<li>We tell Inform exactly what forms of input will cause the action to
happen, using Understand rules.</li>
<li>We write some code that tells Inform exactly what to do when the
action happens. (This would include both things that happen if the
action succeeds, and messages that will print out if the action fails
  for some reason.)</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="../RB_6.html">Chapter 6 of the <em>Recipe Book,</em> “Commands”</a>, has a lot of good
information on how to create your own actions. If you haven’t read this
yet, give it a look.</p>

<p>To illustrate the various possibilities for creating actions, we’re
going to create an action that will happen when the player uses the verb
PAINT. Painting is not an action that’s built into Inform, but painting
something might be a way of solving a puzzle in your game.</p>

<p>The most basic form of this action is one that takes no nouns at all
&ndash; the bare command PAINT. We can create it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Test Lab is a room. &quot;Many devious tests are conducted here. You can see a wooden fence.&quot;\n\nA wooden fence is scenery in the Lab.\n\nPainting is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;paint&quot; as painting.\n\nCheck painting:\n\tsay &quot;You don&apos;t have any paint.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Test Lab is a room. "Many devious tests are conducted here. You can see a wooden fence."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A wooden fence is scenery in the Lab.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing. Understand "paint" as painting.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check painting:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You don't have any paint." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>If you compile this game and test it, you’ll see the following
output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>paint</div>

<p>You don't have any paint.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>paint the fence</div>

<p>I only understood you as far as wanting to paint.</p>
</div>

<p>The painting action as we’ve defined it does nothing at all: The
check rule has no exceptions. We could, however, make an exception if we
wanted to, using an Instead rule. For instance, we might do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check painting when the location is the Paint Store:\n\tsay &quot;You find it impossible to choose from among the hundreds of\ntempting colors.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check painting when the location is the Paint Store:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You find it impossible to choose from among the hundreds of</div>
<div class="codeline">tempting colors." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>Most often, we’d expect the player to want to paint some particular
thing, so the example above is included mainly to illustrate the
simplest way to create a new action, one that has no noun. We’ve defined
the action (“Painting is an action applying to nothing.”) We’ve told
Inform what inputs will trigger the action (“Understand “paint” as
painting.”) And we’ve written a Check rule that will run when the
painting action is being processed. Because we haven’t defined any
grammar that would match the command PAINT THE FENCE, the parser reports
that it has failed: “I only understood you as far as wanting to
paint.”</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that by default, a Check rule does
<em>not</em> stop the processing of the action. After the Check rule
runs, the Carry Out, After, and Report rules for the action will all run
&ndash; unless one of them stops the process. To prevent this, if you want
action processing to stop after your check rule, tack the word “instead”
on at the end of the say phrase you’re printing out in the Check rule.
As you might guess, this causes the Check rule to operate more like an
Instead rule, and Instead rules fail by default, so after your Check
rule has run, action processing will halt.</p>

<p>Next, let’s look at how to paint something. This example is going to
get complicated, because in order to actually do any painting we’ll
need, at the very least, a paintbrush, and quite likely a can of paint
as well. But we can start by creating the action we’ll need. Remember,
we’ve already created an action called painting (which applies to
nothing), so we can’t call our new action painting. Let’s call it
paint-applying:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Paint-applying is an action applying to one thing and requiring\nlight. Understand &quot;paint [something]&quot;, &quot;put paint on [something]&quot;, and\n&quot;apply paint to [something]&quot; as paint-applying.\n\nCheck paint-applying:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] [look] fine the way [they] [are].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Paint-applying is an action applying to one thing and requiring</div>
<div class="codeline">light. Understand "paint [something]", "put paint on [something]", and</div>
<div class="codeline">"apply paint to [something]" as paint-applying.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check paint-applying:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] [look] fine the way [they] [are]."</div>
</div>

<p>The odd-looking stuff with square brackets in the Check rule’s say
line cleverly formats the output text as singular (“The wooden fence
looks fine the way it is.”) if the noun is singular, and as plural (“The
galoshes look fine the way they are.”) if the noun is plural.</p>

<p>As before, this action does nothing except print out an error
message. But now PAINT THE FENCE will produce a sensible output.</p>

<p>The essential thing to notice is the use of the grammar token
“[something]” in the action’s Understand sentence. The token
“[something]” will match any object that is in scope &ndash; that is, any
object that is visible to the player character. This is the heart of
creating new actions in Inform.</p>

<p>The phrase “and requiring light” in the definition of the action is
useful mainly if your game includes any dark rooms. Painting is
obviously an action that requires light, so if the player is in a dark
room we want to make sure she can’t paint anything, even if she does
have all of the necessary painting implements.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to do, of course, is to add a painting
implement, specifically a paintbrush, so that the player can type PAINT
FENCE WITH PAINTBRUSH. For this tutorial, I’m not going to bother adding
a paint can that the brush needs to be dipped into. This brush comes
fully loaded with paint, which is not very realistic, but it will
simplify the code in the examples.</p>

<p>When creating an action that requires two nouns, it’s a very good
idea to give the action a name that includes “it with”, “it on”, “it
under”, or some similar phrase. In this case, we’re going to create an
action called “painting it with”. Giving the action this type of name &ndash;
“xxxxing it with” &ndash; is not required, but if you forget to do it, your
code will be hard to read, and you’ll probably have more bugs to fix. In
some cases, you might need to use a different preposition. For instance,
you might need to create an action called “unfastening it from” or
“placing it near”.</p>

<p>Here is a fairly complete bunch of code that includes all three of
our new painting actions. As you’ll see, the Check rule has a fairly
deep and tangled set of indentations. If you’re trying out this game,
you’ll need to copy these with care. Even better would be to develop an
understanding of <a href="#indenting">how indentation works in Inform</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>This code is written in a way that assumes the player will never need
to paint anything except the wooden fence. If several objects in the
game can be painted, it would have to be changed. In that case, we might
want to use Instead rules for each paintable object rather than Carry
Out and Report rules. The code could be expanded in other ways. For
instance, we might want to change the color of the fence after it’s
painted. But this example should give you a better idea how to create a
new action.</p>

<p>You might notice a couple of other things too. We’ve allowed the
fence to be either painted or unpainted. This is a new property we’ve
created, which exists only for the fence object. This is so we can give
the player an error message if he tries to paint the fence more than
once. We’ve added some vocabulary words to the wooden fence object
(“freshly” and “painted”) that can only be used by the player after the
fence is painted.</p>

<p>We’ve also told Inform that the printed name of the fence (the name
printed out when the game runs) depends on whether it has been painted.
Finally, the room description refers to “[wooden fence]”, so the room
description will change after the fence is painted.</p>

<p>You may want to study the logic of the Check rule for painting it
with. It’s important to get the if-tests in a sensible order. The first
question is, is the second noun something other than the paintbrush? If
so, print an error message and stop (using the “instead” to stop the
action processing). If the second noun <em>is</em> the paintbrush, we
then ask, has the player neglected to pick up the paintbrush? (It might
be locked up in the glass case, or just lying on the ground.) Next, we
check whether the noun is something other than the fence. If not &ndash; if
the player is indeed trying to paint the fence &ndash; then the fourth
question to ask is, is the fence painted already? Only if the answers to
all four of those questions are “No” will the action processing move on
to the Carry Out rule.</p>

<p>If these four questions are in some other order, the output might not
be so sensible. If we put the question of whether the fence is painted
first, for instance, this output could happen:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>paint the bucket with the apple</div>

<p>You already did that.</p>
</div>

<p>Trust me, players will sometimes try absurd commands like that, just
to see what will happen. If they’re beta-testing your game, that’s what
you <em>want</em> them to do. When creating a new action, it’s a good
idea to think about all of the silly things a player might try. What
happens if she tries to perform the action on herself? On another
character? On something she’s wearing?</p>

<p>I tested the code above at least a dozen times while writing it. I
tried all of the absurd inputs as I could think of, such as PAINT FENCE
WITH APPLE, just to see what would happen. When writing a new action,
you’ll want to go through quite a bit of testing yourself before letting
your trusted team of testers try torturing the game.</p>

<h3 id="any-thing">[Any Thing]</h3>

<p>Earlier in this chapter, I explained that the first step in
processing an action is to make sure the object or objects that the
player is talking about are in scope &ndash; that is, that they’re visible in
the room. This happens because the grammar for actions (the Understand
rule) normally uses the token “[something]”. The code for the new action
called paint-applying, a page or two back, gives a good example.</p>

<p>If we want to bypass scope checking, we can change this to the token
“[any thing]”. The token “[any thing]” puts every object in the game in
scope, no matter what room it’s in (or, for that matter, if it’s
nowhere). Please don’t bypass scope checking for casual reasons, because
it will make a mess of the realistic effects that Inform tries to
create. Once in a while, though, it may be useful. For instance, you
could give your players more or less the same power as the debugging
PURLOIN command, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Acquiring is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand &quot;acquire [any thing]&quot; as acquiring.\n\nCheck acquiring:\n\tif the player encloses the noun:\n\t\tsay &quot;You already have [the noun].&quot; instead.\n\nCarry out acquiring:\n\tnow the player carries the noun.\n\nReport acquiring:\n\tsay &quot;You are now carrying [the noun].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Acquiring is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "acquire [any thing]" as acquiring.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check acquiring:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player encloses the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You already have [the noun]." instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out acquiring:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report acquiring:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You are now carrying [the noun]."</div>
</div>

<p>Note the use of “one visible thing” in the definition of the
acquiring action. When writing an action that can apply to “[any
thing]”, you need to do this. <span id="Ref_visible_thing"
class="anchor"></span>Oddly enough, “one visible thing” is a more
<em>general</em> term than “one thing.” In effect, “one thing” means
“one thing that the player can both see and touch,” while “one visible
thing” means “one thing that is visible (but we don’t care whether the
player can touch it or not)”. If you fail to specify “one visible
thing”, your magic grab-anything command will fail: The parser will
complain that the player is unable to reach into a distant room. In
other words, the desired object will fail the touchability test.</p>

<div class="addendum">
It's generally not *useful* to use a token with "[any]" without the grammar line in question being associated with a visible thing, but it's not necessary. And "visible thing" has nothing to do with visibility: it could mean to literally any object &ndash;, in or out of scope, on-stage or off-stage. Its domain is thus limited *only* by the grammar line. Unless you're writing some sort of not-for-release debugging command, you almost certainly do no want to have an action that applies to a visible thing associated with a grammar line with "[any thing]"&hellip; at least not without an adjective limiting the selection. For instance, Approaches by Emily Short uses Understand "go to [any visited room]" with an action applying to one visible thing to implement a command letting the player return to a visited room.
</div>

<p>The acquiring action might make a reasonable magic spell if your
player character is a powerful wizard, able to summon distant objects,
but you’ll want to be careful how you write the Check rule for it.
Several things can go wrong if you let the player use this type of spell
indiscriminately. The <a
href="#Ref_any_topic">previously discussed “[any thing]” token</a> is also useful
for creating topics of conversation &ndash; abstract objects that are never
anywhere in the model world. But if you’re doing this, and <em>also</em>
using “[any thing]” to magically manipulate objects that do appear in
the model world, you need to make sure the Check rule handles all of the
possibilities. If you’ve created a SHAZAM spell that can acquire distant
objects and “India” exists not as a real physical object in the model
world but simply as an object that can be talked about, you don’t want
the naughty player to be able to do this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> shazam india</div>
</div>

<p>With a swirl of sparkling light, India appears in your hands!</p>

<p>What’s worse, SHAZAM ME will produce a run-time error.</p>

<p>For an example that might be more useful, let’s suppose we want the
player to be able to dig a hole. We’ll give the player a shovel, and
we’ll assume the setting is outdoors. (If you have both indoor and
outdoor rooms, you’ll need to do some extra checking before you let the
player dig a hole!) The problem we have to solve is that the hole isn’t
in scope until after the action takes place. There isn’t any hole in the
room until the player digs it, so how can we arrange matters so that the
player can use the command DIG HOLE?</p>

<p>The way to solve this little problem is to use “[any thing]”. We’ll
create the hole offstage and then move it into the room when the player
gives the command. Here’s a simple game that shows how to do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest Path is a room. &quot;Tall trees surround you.&quot;\n\nThe player carries a shovel.\n\nThe hole is an open container.

<h3 id="same-action-new-results">Same Action, New Results</h3>

<p>Some puzzles are designed to force the player to take a given action
several times. For instance, the player might be required to knock on a
door three times before someone will open the door. To do this in
Inform, you would most likely use Instead rules and the phrases “for the
first time,” “for the second time,” “for the third time,” and so on.
It’s important also to write a default rule for handling the action if
it’s attempted more often than you’ve explicitly allowed for. In the
example below, the Report rule for our new knocking on action takes care
of this.</p>

<p>The chapel door is west of the Grand Entry Hall and east of the
Chapel. The chapel door is a door. The chapel door is scenery and
locked.</p>

</div>

<p>If you write a puzzle like this, it’s important to give the player a
clue that the action should be repeated. If the first response to KNOCK
ON DOOR is a bare “Nothing happens” or some similar phrase, the player
is unlikely to try the action again.</p>

<h3 id="redirecting-an-action">Redirecting an Action</h3>

<p>Situations can arise in which a game needs to respond to a particular
command by turning it into a different command. The tool for this is, as
you might guess, the Instead rule. When the player tries one command, an
Instead rule intercepts it and turns it into a different command.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example. (For a slightly more complex example, see the <a
href="#mr-potato-head">Mr. Potato Head example</a>.)
The player is in a room called At the Foot of a Tree. Perched in the
Tree is a separate room above it. The tree itself is scenery in the
first room, and we want the player to be able to climb the tree. The
command CLIMB TREE will result in the same action as the command GO
UP:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`At the Foot of a Tree is a room. &quot;You&apos;re standing at the foot of a tall tree. Sturdy low-hanging branches suggest that it may be easy to climb.&quot;\n\nThe tall tree is scenery in At the Foot of a Tree. Understand &quot;sturdy&quot; and &quot;branches&quot; as the tall tree.\n\nPerched in the Tree is up from At the Foot of a Tree. &quot;The view from up here is spectacular (though admittedly rather leafy).&quot;\n\nInstead of climbing the tall tree:\n\ttry going up.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">At the Foot of a Tree is a room. "You're standing at the foot of a tall tree. Sturdy low-hanging branches suggest that it may be easy to climb."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The tall tree is scenery in At the Foot of a Tree. Understand "sturdy" and "branches" as the tall tree.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Perched in the Tree is up from At the Foot of a Tree. "The view from up here is spectacular (though admittedly rather leafy)."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of climbing the tall tree:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try going up.</div>
</div>

<p>It may seem that we could just as easily have said, “Instead of
climbing the tall tree: now the player is in Perched in the Tree.” And
indeed, in the example above, that would produce pretty much the same
result (although there would be a missing empty line in the output
between the player’s command and the room name). But redirecting the
CLIMB TREE action to the GO UP action allows us to handle more complex
game situations in a graceful way.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose, for instance, that the player may be carrying
something so heavy that it would make climbing the tree difficult or
impossible. If we’ve redirected CLIMB TREE to GO UP, we only need to
test this condition once. If CLIMB TREE and GO UP remain separate
actions that send the player to the same destination, then we’ll have to
test what the player is carrying in two different pieces of code, which
makes the code harder to write and harder to debug.</p>

<p>Because the Instead rule shown above redirects the climbing action to
the going up action, turning the tree-climbing action into a puzzle
(absurdly easy, but a puzzle for all that) requires very little effort.
After the code above, we add the following:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a heavy iron anvil. The description is &quot;The iron anvil must weigh at least a hundred pounds.&quot;\n\nInstead of going up in At the Foot of a Tree:\n\tif the player encloses the anvil:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;ll never be able to climb the tree while carrying something so heavy.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a heavy iron anvil. The description is "The iron anvil must weigh at least a hundred pounds."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going up in At the Foot of a Tree:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player encloses the anvil:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'll never be able to climb the tree while carrying something so heavy.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player will see the same “You’ll never be able to climb”
message, whether he typed CLIMB TREE or UP.</p>

<p>Inform allows you to test what action the player is attempting, but
the syntax is a little tricky. For an example that shows how to do it,
see <a href="#restraints">Restraints</a>.</p>

<h3 id="actions-with-topics">Actions with Topics</h3>

<p>Inform provides an action called consulting it about. By default,
this does nothing except print out a message that says, “You discover
nothing of interest in [the noun].” The results, if the player tries
LOOK UP EXPLOSIVES IN MRS SMITH, are rather comical, because Inform
seems to be implying that there is actually a way of looking things up
in Mrs. Smith. We’ll want to fix that. Nonetheless, we can use this
action to create an encyclopedia &ndash; or for that matter, a computer
terminal &ndash; in which the player can look up whatever topics we like.
Here’s an encyclopedia:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The encyclopedia is in the Library. The description is &quot;A massive 27-volume set of the Encyclopedia Frobozzica. You could probably look up almost anything in it!&quot; Understand &quot;volume&quot; and &quot;book&quot; as the encyclopedia.\n\nInstead of consulting the encyclopedia about something:\n\tsay &quot;Flipping through the encyclopedia, you learn that [run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\tif the topic understood is a topic listed in the Table of Encyclopedia Entries:\n\t\tsay &quot;[article entry][paragraph break]&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;there&apos;s nothing in the encyclopedia on that topic.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of consulting someone about something:\n\tsay &quot;Does [the noun] look like an encyclopedia?&quot;\n\nInstead of consulting something about something:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] [are] not a likely-looking source of information.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The encyclopedia is in the Library.

<p>The main part of this code uses a <em>table</em>. Tables are Inform’s
way of keeping large amounts of data organized; for more on tables, see
<a href="#tables">Tables</a>. The main thing you need to know about
tables, at the moment, is that they contain rows and columns, and that
the items in each row are separated by Tab characters. There is a single
return character at the end of each row.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Tab characters are <em>not</em> kept
by a copy-paste action if you select the code above in Adobe Reader
(Windows) or Preview (Mac) and copy it into Inform. If you do that,
you’ll need to replace the Tabs yourself, in order to get the game to
compile. In addition, extra return characters may be <em>added</em> when
you copy and paste text from the <em>Handbook.</em> These returns will
have to be stripped out after you copy the example into Inform’s
IDE.</p>

<p>Inform’s IDE doesn’t display Tab-separated tables any better than the
word processor I’m using to write this book. As a result, a table that
has long entries, like the one above, can be difficult to understand or
debug just by looking at it. It’s a mess. Here’s what the table above
would look like if we could use a real word processor table (which we
can’t do, because Inform wouldn’t understand it):</p>
</div>

</table>

<p>With the code shown above, the player can CONSULT ENCYCLOPEDIA ABOUT
SWORDS or LOOK UP WEAPONRY IN ENCYCLOPEDIA. Both commands lead to the
consulting it about action, and from there to the entry in the article
column in the table. If you look at the entries in the topic column for
the table, you’ll find that each entry has several texts separated by
the word <em>or.</em> It’s important to spell out all of the variations
you think your player might try to use. The last row in the table, for
instance, has no entry under topic for “weapon”, because I forgot to add
one. If the player tries to LOOK UP WEAPON IN ENCYCLOPEDIA, the default
response (“&hellip;there’s nothing in the encyclopedia on that topic”) will
be printed out. In this case, that would be a misleading response.</p>

<p>The last two Instead rules in this example provide better responses
for when the player tries to look up a topic in something other than the
encyclopedia.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-5-creating-characters">Chapter 5: Creating Characters</h2>

<p>Stories are about people. Because
interactive fiction is a form of storytelling, it’s almost inevitable
that you’ll want to include a few people in your game. A story with no
people in it probably won’t be very interesting or fun &ndash; at least not
for very long. If your players can’t do anything but wander around
picking up treasures and fighting off monsters, before too long they’ll
start to get bored. Besides, even a monster is a person, loosely
speaking.</p>

<p>Using Inform, you can add people (or talking animals, or whatever
sort of odd characters you’d like) to the games you write. Creating
lifelike characters is an important skill to learn, and it may be the
most complicated part of writing IF. In this chapter we’ll cover the
basics of creating characters and also look at a few advanced techniques
that you’ll probably want to use as your story develops.</p>

<p>Programming a non-player character (the abbreviation “NPC” is used
throughout the interactive fiction community to refer to a non-player
character) is complicated because people are complicated. Think about
the differences between interacting with your Uncle Fred and interacting
with a bowling ball. Uncle Fred does things on his own &ndash; that is, he
initiates activities. A bowling ball doesn’t. Uncle Fred may observe you
and comment on something you’re doing. A bowling ball won’t. Uncle Fred
may respond to you differently depending on whether he’s happy or sad,
or on whether he’s upset with you. A bowling ball will respond exactly
the same whether it’s red or black or zebra-striped. (If it’s lopsided,
all bets are off.)</p>

<p>The ways that people interact with one another are also complicated:
Uncle Fred might respond differently if you shout or whisper, but a
bowling ball won’t. To make matters worse, shouting and whispering are
not modeled in most IF conversation systems.</p>

<p>Whoever plays your game will naturally hope (or worse, expect) that
the player character will be able to interact with other characters the
same way the player herself would interact with a real person. Sadly,
that degree of realism is just about impossible to achieve using today’s
interactive fiction programming tools. The parser is designed to accept
in puts in the form &lt;VERB&gt; &lt;NOUN&gt; &lt;PREPOSITION&gt;
&lt;NOUN&gt;. Anything more complicated is not likely to work well. The
only wrinkle that is usually added to this system is that the player may
be able to give commands to an NPC. The syntax for this begins with the
name (or other identifier, such as “dragon” or “frog”) of the NPC, then
a comma, then the usual syntax. For instance, BOB, PUT THE BOMB ON THE
TABLE.</p>

<p>Why not design a parser that will accept more complex interactions
with NPCs? This turns out to be a difficult problem in computer science.
Various people have tried it, but so far, the results have not been
inspiring. Technically, it’s possible to write a game that will respond
to whatever complicated player inputs you’d like. If you want your game
to respond to ASK EMILY WHETHER EMILE’S DOG IS STILL TOO SICK TO HUNT
FOR THE SQUIRREL, you can do it using the “after reading a command”
activity, as explained in <a href="../WI_18.html#section_33">WI 18.33 Reading a command</a>. But there are several problems with
this type of trick, including the problem of letting the player know
that such a complex input is possible. I don’t recommend that authors go
down that road in their first or second game.</p>

<p>Even while sticking within the limitations of “normal” IF
programming, we can employ various tricks to make our characters seem
more real. The characters may be just the software equivalent of
cardboard, but players will enjoy meeting and talking with them.</p>

<p>Before we start talking about specific programming techniques, we
need to talk about how you might want to use characters in your
interactive story. What roles or functions might they take on?</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="believeable-characters">
<h4>Believable Characters</h4>

<p>Characters will seem more believable if the player’s interaction with
them is limited. This could be because the NPC plays a limited role in
the story, or does not know the PC (player character): It’s a lot easier
to make a guard believable than a girlfriend! You can also limit the
interaction with a character by moving the character onstage and
offstage again quickly. Characters who have a single-minded obsession
with one thing (for instance, a king who only cares about whether you’re
a spy) are easier to create than characters who are just hanging out.
But the latter sort (Emily Short’s Galatea, from the game of the same
name) can be vivid and memorable.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>To begin with, your players will probably want to be able to talk to
the other characters. There are several ways to set up a conversation
system. Each method has advantages, and also weaknesses, as we’ll
see.</p>

<p>One common reason to want to have a conversation with a character is
to try to learn something useful. If you’re writing a game about
criminals, for instance, ASK POLICEMAN ABOUT BURGLAR might be an
important command for the player to try. Another reason to have a
conversation is because you hope to cause the character to do something.
If the player types TELL POLICEMAN ABOUT BURGLAR, the policeman might
rush off to arrest the burglar &ndash; a real change in the world of the story
that won’t take place unless the player gives that command.</p>

<p>The player character may need help doing something, and may want to
ask another character for help. For instance, a player character who has
only normal strength might want to enlist the aid of a weight-lifter to
move a boulder. So the player may need a way to give instructions to
other characters. ASK REGINALD TO LIFT THE BOULDER could be an important
part of the game.</p>

<p>Characters may have possessions that the player needs. One common
type of instruction is to ask for an object. If you ASK MARY FOR DIAMOND
NECKLACE, she might refuse to part with it, or she might give it to you,
depending on how the game is written.</p>

<p>Some characters are stationary &ndash; they’re always in one room. Other
characters may wander around the map. They may follow the PC, or run
away when the PC approaches.</p>

<p>Characters will sometimes carry out simple tasks on their own, such
as stealing things from the player or even killing the player.</p>

<p>When a character is in the same room as the player, the character may
seem more lifelike if it’s carrying out some sort of “stage business,”
engaging in a minor activity every turn, or once every few turns, just
to remind the player that there’s someone else in the room. If the
character is doing this type of stage business, nothing is likely to
change in the room (although it could &ndash; the butler might be polishing
the silverware for 20 turns, and at the end of that time the description
of the silverware might change to say that it’s spotless and shining).
All that usually happens is that the game prints out a brief message
describing a nonexistent action.</p>

<p>If your story takes place in a world where there’s lots of fighting
(swordfights or laser guns, your choice!), you may want the player to
engage in hand-to-hand combat with other characters.</p>

<p>Groups of characters require special handling. If your player
character is facing a crowd of angry villagers armed with torches and
pitchforks, you probably don’t want to create a hundred different
villager characters. For one thing, it’s a lot of work, and you won’t
gain much in terms of realism or a more dramatic story. A better method
will usually be to create a single “crowd” object (which might not be a
person at all, as far as Inform is concerned) and then create a single
“spokesperson” man or woman, an actual Inform NPC object, who will
engage in any conversation or other activities. On the other hand, if
you’re writing an Agatha Christie type of murder mystery, you may want
to have as many as six or seven individual characters (the suspects) all
sitting around in the drawing room at the same time. Inform provides
some fascinating tools with which to allow these characters to relate to
one another. (See <a href="#relations">Relations</a>.)
</div>
<h3 id="the-player-character">The Player Character</h3>

<p>Pleasantly little needs to be said about creating the player
character (PC). Your PC can have any identity you might like, from a
mile-high evil robot to a small, cuddly bunny rabbit. Or the PC could be
a sort of blank &ndash; a shadow character that the actual player can project
his or her own personality into.</p>

<p>To start creating a PC, all you need to do is write a
description:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description of the player is &quot;In the absence of a mirror, you&apos;re\nnot quite sure what you look like today.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description of the player is "In the absence of a mirror, you're</div>
<div class="codeline">not quite sure what you look like today."</div>
</div>

<p>In games that are puzzle-oriented rather than people-oriented, that
may be all you need to do. Depending on the character you’ve chosen,
though, you may want to write non-standard messages for situations in
which the PC either does something, or doesn’t. For instance, your PC
might be very timid. In that case, the PC would naturally hesitate to do
certain things that another PC might have no trouble doing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the spider, say &quot;You can&apos;t bring yourself even to\nget near it.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the spider, say "You can't bring yourself even to</div>
<div class="codeline">get near it."</div>
</div>

<p>At the other extreme, the PC might be rambunctious, ill-mannered, or
just plain evil. He might enjoy breaking things, for instance. This fact
could lead you to write code like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Some dishes are in the Lab. The dishes can be broken or unbroken. The dishes are unbroken. The printed name of the dishes is &quot;[if broken]broken [end if]dishes&quot;. Understand &quot;broken&quot; as the dishes when the dishes are broken.\n\nInstead of attacking the dishes:\n\tif the dishes are broken:\n\t\tsay &quot;You already took care of that little chore.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tnow the dishes are broken;\n\t\tsay &quot;You smash the dishes with gusto!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Some dishes are in the Lab. The dishes can be broken or unbroken. The dishes are unbroken. The printed name of the dishes is "[if broken]broken [end if]dishes". Understand "broken" as the dishes when the dishes are broken.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of attacking the dishes:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the dishes are broken:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You already took care of that little chore.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the dishes are broken;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You smash the dishes with gusto!"</div>
</div>

<p>The point of this code is to respond to the command BREAK THE DISHES
with the line, “You smash the dishes with gusto!” Customizing Inform’s
standard outputs is a simple way of giving a specific character to the
PC.</p>

<p>In the early days of interactive fiction, a number of games were
released in which the PC changed identity during the course of the game
&ndash; essentially, switching from one body to another. This isn’t done too
often anymore, but if you want to do it, it isn’t difficult. All you
need is a couple of lines of code. In the silly little example below,
we’ll use pressing a button to cause the PC to swap bodies with an NPC.
In a real game, you might use a magical device of some sort, or have the
PC wake up from a dream and discover that she’s really someone else.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Test Lab is a room. &quot;Many devious tests are conducted here.&quot;\n\nBingo is an animal in the Lab. The description is &quot;[if the player is Bingo]You are[otherwise]Bingo is[end if] a peppy-looking cocker spaniel.&quot;\n\nBob is a man in the Lab.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You feel odd for a moment Yes, you're human again, and muscular, and male."</div>
</div>

<p>In a real game, many other messages and rules would have to test
whether the player is Bob, Linda, or Bingo, and change the results of
the player’s commands based on the PC’s identity.</p>

<h3 id="creating-an-npc">Creating an NPC</h3>

<p>Creating a new non-player character is easy. Assuming we’ve created a
room called the Billiard Room, we can then write:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. The description is “Troy looks\ndevilishly handsome in his tuxedo, but you’re not sure you trust him.”\nTroy is wearing a tuxedo.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. The description is “Troy looks</div>
<div class="codeline">devilishly handsome in his tuxedo, but you’re not sure you trust him.”</div>
<div class="codeline">Troy is wearing a tuxedo.</div>
</div>

<p>The assertion, “Troy is wearing a tuxedo” both creates an object (the
tuxedo) and lets Inform know that the tuxedo is wearable. (If you
actually want the player to wear the tuxedo at some point in the story,
you’ll have to write some code for getting it away from Troy. By
default, characters won’t let go of things they’re wearing or
carrying.)</p>

<p>In fact, the sentence “Troy is wearing a tuxedo” lets Inform know
that Troy is a person, because only people and animals can wear things.
By default, an object that you say is wearing something will be male and
a person, not an animal. So we can delete the words “a man” in the code
above and get exactly the same result. I suggest always saying that an
NPC is a man or a woman, however, because if you should later change
your mind about having the NPC wear something and delete the sentence
about the tuxedo, the NPC will no longer be a man, just a thing.</p>

<p>If you use this code in a game, you’ll find that when the player
enters the billiard room, the game reports, “You can see Troy here.” As
you’ll recall from Chapter 3, we can improve the output by giving the
Troy object an initial appearance<em>.</em> The initial appearance is
formatted exactly like a room description &ndash; it appears immediately after
we create Troy, and is written as a double-quoted sentence that stands
by itself. The sentence below that begins, “Troy is leaning
nonchalantly” is an initial appearance.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. “Troy is leaning nonchalantly\nagainst a corner of the billiard table, pretending not to notice you.”\nThe description is “Troy looks devilishly handsome in his tuxedo, but\nyou’re not sure you trust him.” Troy is wearing a tuxedo.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. “Troy is leaning nonchalantly</div>
<div class="codeline">against a corner of the billiard table, pretending not to notice you.”</div>
<div class="codeline">The description is “Troy looks devilishly handsome in his tuxedo, but</div>
<div class="codeline">you’re not sure you trust him.” Troy is wearing a tuxedo.</div>
</div>

<p>Now, when the player enters the billiard room, the room description
will include, instead of the boring line “You can see Troy here,” the
much more colorful line, “Troy is leaning nonchalantly against a corner
of the billiard table, pretending not to notice you.” I’d recommend
always giving an NPC an initial appearance.</p>

<p>At present, Troy doesn’t do much. But even at this stage, Inform
understands that a person is different from most other types of objects.
Here’s a transcript of what can happen in the billiard room with no more
code for Troy than what we’ve written above:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>kiss troy</div>
<p>Troy might not like that.</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>kiss tuxedo</div>
<p>You can only do that to something animate.</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take troy</div>
<p>I don't suppose Troy would care for that.</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take tuxedo</div>
<p>That seems to belong to Troy.</p>
</div>

<p>As you can see, Inform automatically understands that kissing is
something that the player character can do to people (or to animals),
but not to inanimate objects. If we try to take a person, the default
error message prevents it &ndash; and if we try to take something that a
person is wearing or carrying, we get a different error message.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you need the player to be able to kiss an inanimate
object &ndash; perhaps you’ve created the Pope as a character, and the player
is expected to kiss the Pope’s ring &ndash; you’ll find that a simple Instead
rule won’t do the job. A Before rule won’t work either. This is because
the Inform library defines the kissing action more or less like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand “kiss [someone]” as kissing.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand “kiss [someone]” as kissing.</div>
</div>

<p>The grammar token “[someone]” won’t match an inanimate object; it
will only match a person. So an Instead or Before rule will never have a
chance to get into the act: the command KISS RING will be rejected by
the game’s parser. The same thing happens, by the way, with the GIVE TO
and SHOW TO actions, though those are less likely to cause problems,
because it’s hard to think of a reason why you would want the player to
be able to show or give something to an inanimate object!</p>

<p>We’ll borrow a bit from Chapter 4 of the <em>Handbook</em>,
“Actions,” and show how to make it possible to kiss something inanimate.
We don’t need to define a separate kissing action for inanimate things &ndash;
all we need to do is add a grammar line and define a default “you can’t
do that” message:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;kiss [something]&quot; as kissing.\n\nInstead of kissing something which is not a person:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] [don&apos;t] look very sanitary.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "kiss [something]" as kissing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of kissing something which is not a person:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] [don't] look very sanitary."</div>
</div>

<p>Now we can write an instead rule that will allow the player to pay
osculatory obeisance to Troy’s tuxedo:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of kissing the tuxedo:\n\tsay &quot;Troy graciously allows you to kiss his tuxedo.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of kissing the tuxedo:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Troy graciously allows you to kiss his tuxedo."</div>
</div>

<p>The distinction between “[someone]” and “[something]” is worth
mentioning because it allows us to write new actions that will also
apply only to people. For instance, we might want the player to be able
to flatter other characters. Causing the flattery to affect the
character would take a bit more code, but we can create a basic
flattering action like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Flattering is an action applying to one thing. Understand &quot;flatter [someone]&quot; and &quot;praise [someone]&quot; as flattering.\n\nCheck flattering:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] blushes modestly.&quot;\t\n\nInstead of flattering Troy:\n\tsay &quot;Troy grins at you. &apos;Well, sure. Anything nice you say about me, I gotta believe you mean it.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Flattering is an action applying to one thing. Understand "flatter [someone]" and "praise [someone]" as flattering.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check flattering:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] blushes modestly."&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of flattering Troy:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Troy grins at you. 'Well, sure. Anything nice you say about me, I gotta believe you mean it.'"</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player can flatter any character in the game, thereby
producing the response in the Check rule above. But flattering Troy will
produce a different response, and the parser won’t let the player
flatter inanimate objects. Care is required when writing default
responses, however, because an animal will match the grammar token
“[someone]”. If you’ve got a talking tortoise in your game, you don’t
want the tortoise blushing modestly when flattered!</p>

<p>If you have several male characters in your game, you can handle this
for all of them at once by writing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;man&quot; as a man.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "man" as a man.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidebar" id="man-and-woman">
<h4>“Man” &amp; “Woman”</h4>

<p>If you create an NPC by saying, for instance, “Troy is a man,” the
parser won’t understand the word “man” as referring to Troy. This is
because the name of a kind is not understood as referring to specific
objects of that kind unless you say it is. You have to add the
vocabulary by hand:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. Understand &quot;man&quot; as Troy.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. Understand "man" as Troy.</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="mr.-mrs.">Mr. &amp; Mrs.</h3>

<p>In the U.S., we always put a period after abbreviations like Mr.,
Mrs., Ms., and Dr. In Britain no periods are used. But even if Graham
Nelson weren’t British, the period has some uses in Inform that would
make it tricky to handle those abbreviations.</p>

<p>In source text, Inform understands the period as being the end of a
sentence. So you can’t create a character this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Mrs. Smith is a woman in the drawing room. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Mrs. Smith is a woman in the drawing room. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Inform will think “Mrs” is a separate sentence &ndash; a sentence that
makes no sense. The solution is to leave out the period when creating
Mrs. Smith:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Mrs Smith is a woman in the Drawing Room. &quot;Mrs. Smith is a stout\nwoman of mature years.&quot; Understand &quot;stout&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; as Mrs Smith.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Mrs Smith is a woman in the Drawing Room. "Mrs. Smith is a stout</div>
<div class="codeline">woman of mature years." Understand "stout" and "woman" as Mrs Smith.</div>
</div>

<p>You can refer to her as “Mrs. Smith” in the description, or in any
other output text that you write, but as far as Inform is concerned,
she’s Mrs Smith. To fix this, we need a special rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Rule for printing the name of Mrs Smith: say &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of Mrs Smith: say "Mrs. Smith".</div>
</div>

<p>One problem remains: If the player types X MRS. SMITH, the parser
won’t know what the player means. Inform won’t allow periods to be used
in Understand text, so we can’t do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;stout&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, and &quot;Mrs.&quot; as Mrs Smith. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "stout", "woman", and "Mrs." as Mrs Smith. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Also, if the player types a command that includes a period, the
parser will understand it as two separate commands. For example, the
player can move quickly from room to room (assuming she knows the route)
like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>n. e. n. nw</div>
</div>

<p>As far as the parser is concerned, those are four separate commands.
This is a handy feature found in most modern IF interpreters. In the
example above, X MRS. SMITH would produce the description of an object
whose name includes the word “Mrs”, because the parser would understand
the first command as X MRS &ndash; but SMITH would look to the parser like a
separate command, one that is not likely to be understood. To prevent
this, we have to use an advanced feature of Inform &ndash; the “after reading
a command” activity. As soon as the player hits the Return/Enter key to
issue a command, we’re going to look for an input that matches “MRS.”
and replace it with “MRS” before the parser gets a chance to process it.
While we’re at it, we’ll fix the other common abbreviations too:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command:\n\tlet T be text;\n\tlet T be the player&apos;s command;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;mrs\.&quot; in T with &quot;mrs&quot;;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;mr\.&quot; in T with &quot;mr&quot;;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;ms\.&quot; in T with &quot;ms&quot;;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;dr\.&quot; in T with &quot;dr&quot;;\n\tchange the text of the player&apos;s command to T.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be text;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be the player's command;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "mrs\." in T with "mrs";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "mr\." in T with "mr";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "ms\." in T with "ms";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "dr\." in T with "dr";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;change the text of the player's command to T.</div>
</div>

<p>I’m not going to try to explain every line in that code, because
regular expressions are an advanced topic, not something we’ll explore
in detail in the <em>Handbook</em>. If you’re curious, you can learn
more by reading <a href="../WI_20.html">WI Chapter 20: Advanced Text</a>. If you don’t have the patience for that,
just copy the code above exactly, and it will do the job. (If you’re
retyping it, don’t skip the backslash characters before the periods, or
skip the hard-to-see periods themselves.)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Emily%20Short/Punctuation%20Removal.i7x">Punctuation Removal by Emily Short</a> is an extension providing
simple way of getting rid of the periods in the player’s input. This
extension, which is bundled with Inform, allows us to skip typing the

it in the Extensions tab in the IDE.</p>

<h3 id="conversations-part-i-talk-to">Conversations, Part I: talk to</h3>

<p>The easiest way to let your
players talk to NPCs is by creating a “talk to” action. Here’s a code
sample that will produce a simple conversation:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand &quot;talk to [someone]&quot; or “converse with [someone]” as talking to.\n\nCheck talking to: say &quot;[The noun] doesn&apos;t reply.&quot;\n\nInstead of talking to Troy:\n\tsay &quot;[one of]&apos;Hi, there,&apos; you say confidently.[paragraph break]&apos;What&apos;s happening?&apos; he replies casually.[or]&apos;I&apos;ve been meaning to ask you about that tuxedo,&apos; you comment. &apos;Where did you get it?&apos;[paragraph break]&apos;My tailor is quite exclusive,&apos; Troy replies, inspecting his cuff. &apos;He would never consent to clothe riffraff like you.&apos;[or]&apos;You really are a stuck-up snob, aren&apos;t you?&apos; you say hotly.[paragraph break]Troy laughs heartily. &apos;I was just yanking your chain. I bought it at Macy&apos;s for $60 at a clearance sale. I&apos;ll give it to you if you like.&apos;[or]You decide against talking any further with Troy right now.[stopping]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Talking to is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "talk to [someone]" or “converse with [someone]” as talking to.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check talking to: say "[The noun] doesn't reply."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of talking to Troy:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]'Hi, there,' you say confidently.[paragraph break]'What's happening?' he replies casually.[or]'I've been meaning to ask you about that tuxedo,' you comment. 'Where did you get it?'[paragraph break]'My tailor is quite exclusive,' Troy replies, inspecting his cuff. 'He would never consent to clothe riffraff like you.'[or]'You really are a stuck-up snob, aren't you?' you say hotly.[paragraph break]Troy laughs heartily. 'I was just yanking your chain. I bought it at Macy's for $60 at a clearance sale. I'll give it to you if you like.'[or]You decide against talking any further with Troy right now.[stopping]".</div>
</div>

<p>The most interesting thing about this code is what happens in the
long “say” block. This is set up to give Inform some alternative
outputs. The structure looks like this: “[one
of]&hellip;[or]&hellip;[or]&hellip;[or]&hellip;[stopping]”. This structure is covered down
near the bottom of <a href="../WI_5.html#section_7>Text with random alternatives</a>; also see <a href="#text-insertions">Text Insertions</a>.</p>

<p>When you use this type of code, the player can type TALK TO TROY,
read the first response (up to “[or]”), then type AGAIN (or just G) to
read the second response, and so on. The last response (the one just
before “[stopping]” should always be used to indicate to the player that
there’s nothing further to be gained by trying to talk to the character.
Note also the use of “[paragraph break]” for the outputs that are
separated into paragraphs. The output will look like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>talk to troy</div>

<p>"Hi, there," you say confidently.</p>

<p>"What's happening?" he replies casually.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>g</div>

<p>"I've been meaning to ask you about that tuxedo," you comment. "Where
did you get it?"</p>

<p>"My tailor is quite exclusive," Troy replies, inspecting his cuff.
"He would never consent to clothe riffraff like you."</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>g</div>

<p>"You really are a stuck-up snob, aren't you?" you say hotly.</p>

<p>Troy laughs heartily. "I was just yanking your chain. I bought it at
Macy's for $60 at a clearance sale. I'll give it to you if you
like."</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>g</div>

<p>You decide against talking any further with Troy right now.</p>
</div>

<p>The good thing about a talk to conversation system is that it’s easy
to set up. The bad thing is that it’s quite limited. If the player wants
to ask or tell the character about three or four different things that
may be significant to the story, a talk to system may not do the job.
It’s possible to set up a TALK TO system with logic tests in the Instead
rule &ndash; tests such as “if the cellar has not been visited” could produce
two different streams of conversation depending on whether the cellar
has been visited. But if the conversation is going to move the story
forward, it’s up to the player to use the AGAIN command several times in
order to make sure the conversation is finished, and then perhaps start
a new conversation later.</p>

<p>Another problem is that if the player should try TALK TO TROY only
twice, go to a different room, return a hundred turns later, and try
TALK TO TROY again, the conversation will continue as if there had been
no interruption. This is not realistic.</p>

<p>One easy way to make TALK TO work more flexibly uses Inform’s scenes
feature (see Chapter 7 of the <em>Handbook</em>):</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of talking to Troy during Cocktail Hour:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of talking to Troy during Cocktail Hour:</div>
</div>

<p>A different but also handy use for the TALK TO command might be to
have your game print out some suggested topics for conversation. This
use of the TALK TO command doesn’t produce any actual conversation; the
conversation would occur in an ASK ABOUT or TELL ABOUT command, which is
the subject of the next section.</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>talk to bishop</div>

<p>You could ask the bishop about the crypt, about the impending
eclipse, or about the Uzi he’s carrying.</p>
</div>

<p>This list of possible topics can be fixed, or you can write some code
that will put it together while the game is being played. After the
player has asked about the crypt, for instance, this topic might
disappear from the list of suggested topics, that topic being exhausted.
An extension called <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Conversation%20Suggestions-v6.i7x">Conversation Suggestions by Eric Eve</a> will give you a
framework for setting up topic suggestion lists of this sort. (Note that
Conversation Suggestions is not compatible with the simple TALK TO code
suggested above.)</p>

<h3 id="conversations-part-ii-asktellgiveshow">Conversations, Part II: ask/tell/give/show</h3>

<p>Personally, I favor the ask/tell/give/show conversation system.
(Other game authors disagree.) I feel it gives a good compromise between
realism and challenging the player to figure out what’s important and
therefore worth having a conversation about.</p>

<p>This system is based on five commands:</p>

<p>ASK NPC ABOUT X</p>

<p>TELL NPC ABOUT X</p>

<p>SHOW X TO NPC</p>

<p>GIVE X TO NPC</p>

<p>ASK NPC FOR X</p>

<p>The give to, show to, and ask for actions are included in Inform. To
use them in their basic form, all you need to do is write a few Instead
rules. The ask about and tell about actions are included in Inform in a
limited way: You can ask about or tell about topics (which are just
strings of text), but not about objects that exist in the game unless
you set up topics that have the same vocabulary as the objects. We’ll
take a close look at all of these commands, and show ways to make them
more flexible.</p>

<p>The simplest command to add to your game is give to. Continuing the
earlier example game, with Troy in the Billiard Room, we can do
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a plum.\n\nIn the Billiard Room is a hammer.\n\nInstead of giving the plum to Troy:\n\tsay &quot;Troy inspects the plum carefully, accepts it, and pops it into his mouth.&quot;;\n\tremove the plum from play.\n\nInstead of giving something to Troy:\n\tsay &quot;Troy sneers at you. &apos;I&apos;m not interested,&apos; he says coldly.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a plum.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">In the Billiard Room is a hammer.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of giving the plum to Troy:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Troy inspects the plum carefully, accepts it, and pops it into his mouth.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;remove the plum from play.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of giving something to Troy:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Troy sneers at you. 'I'm not interested,' he says coldly."</div>
</div>

<p>If you add this code to your game, you’ll discover a couple of
things. First, Troy will eat the plum, but will sneer at any other gift
you may offer. (And incidentally, Inform knows that “offer” is a synonym
for “give”.) Second, if you try GIVE HAMMER TO TROY, the parser will
cause you to pick up the hammer first before the giving action is
attempted. This is called implicit taking. It’s a handy feature, because
it saves the player a bit of trouble: You don’t need to PICK UP THE
HAMMER first before giving it to Troy. (See <a href="#action-processing-summary">Action Processing
Summary</a> to learn a
bit more about implicit actions.)</p>

<p>If the implicit taking fails (for instance, if you try to give an NPC
a canary when the canary is in a locked cage), the giving action will
never be attempted. Inform assumes that the PC can only give something
to an NPC while actually holding it.</p>

<p>This makes sense for the giving action (though you’d need to write
some extra code in order to allow the player to give an NPC a poisonous
snake while the snake is curled up inside a cage). But the same
condition applies to the showing action, and here it makes a bit less
sense. What if I want to show an NPC the beautiful sunset? By default,
Inform will try to have the player take the sunset first, and of course
that won’t work.</p>

<p>We can get around this limitation by writing a Before rule (instead
of an Instead rule), like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before showing the tuxedo to Troy:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;Yes,&apos; he replies sarcastically. &apos;I&apos;ve already noticed that I&apos;m\nwearing it.&apos;&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before showing the tuxedo to Troy:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'Yes,' he replies sarcastically. 'I've already noticed that I'm</div>
<div class="codeline">wearing it.'" instead.</div>
</div>

<p>Now you can show the tuxedo to Troy without having the parser try to
have you take the tuxedo (which of course Troy won’t let you have).</p>
</div>
<h4 id="topics-of-conversation">Topics of Conversation</h4>

<p>Inform’s default handling of ASK ABOUT and TELL ABOUT is good in one
way, but bad in another way. These commands are implemented so as to
handle topics, but they don’t know about objects in the game. Let’s
suppose we want the player to be able to ask Troy about that interesting
tuxedo. Here’s the basic way to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Troy about &quot;tuxedo&quot;:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;Oh, you&apos;ve noticed my tuxedo,&apos; he replies. &apos;I&apos;m rather fond of\nit.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Troy about "tuxedo":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'Oh, you've noticed my tuxedo,' he replies. 'I'm rather fond of</div>
<div class="codeline">it.'"</div>
</div>

<p>This is fine as far as it goes. The good news is, we can ask Troy
about abstract topics, such as the meaning of life, using exactly the
same syntax. The meaning of life doesn’t have to be an actual object in
our model world. The disadvantage is that the parser will only match the
<em>exact</em> word or words in the topic. A quick look at the output
will show why this can be a big problem:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>ask troy about tuxedo</div>
<p>"Oh, you've noticed my tuxedo," he replies. "I'm fond of it."</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>ask troy about the tuxedo</div>
<p>There is no reply.</p>
</div>

<p>The Instead rule above didn’t include “the tuxedo” as a text, and
Inform has no idea that the topic “the tuxedo” is the same as the topic
“tuxedo.” Topics are not handled with the same kind of automatic
intelligence as objects, because it wouldn’t be practical for the parser
to do so.</p>

<p>We can get around this limitation in a couple of ways. First, we can
do it by letting Inform know about all of the ways we think the player
might refer to the tuxedo. But it quickly gets a bit awkward:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;tuxedo&quot;, &quot;the tuxedo&quot;, &quot;his tuxedo&quot;, &quot;suit&quot;, &quot;the suit&quot;,\nand &quot;his suit&quot; as &quot;[tuxedo]&quot;.\n\nInstead of asking Troy about &quot;[tuxedo]&quot;:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;Oh, you&apos;ve noticed my tuxedo,&apos; he replies. &apos;I&apos;m rather fond of\nit.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "tuxedo", "the tuxedo", "his tuxedo", "suit", "the suit",</div>
<div class="codeline">and "his suit" as "[tuxedo]".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of asking Troy about "[tuxedo]":</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'Oh, you've noticed my tuxedo,' he replies. 'I'm rather fond of</div>
<div class="codeline">it.'"</div>
</div>

<p>Here we’ve created a new grammar token, “[tuxedo]”, and provided an
understand rule that spells out the words and phrases we want the player
to be able to use. But of course, the careful author will already have
given a vocabulary list to the tuxedo itself:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Troy is wearing a tuxedo. The description of the tuxedo is &quot;Troy&apos;s\ntuxedo is a handsome bit of custom tailoring.&quot; Understand &quot;Troy&apos;s&quot;,\n&quot;handsome&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;, &quot;tailoring&quot;, &quot;suit&quot;, and &quot;attire&quot; as the\ntuxedo.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Troy is wearing a tuxedo. The description of the tuxedo is "Troy's</div>
<div class="codeline">tuxedo is a handsome bit of custom tailoring." Understand "Troy's",</div>
<div class="codeline">"handsome", "custom", "tailoring", "suit", and "attire" as the</div>
<div class="codeline">tuxedo.</div>
</div>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we could use that same vocabulary list while
asking or telling Troy about the tuxedo? Inform lets us do this, and
with only a bit more work. We need to create two new actions, quizzing
it about and informing it about. These will use the same command words
(ask and tell) as Inform’s built-in actions, but we’ll set them up to
respond to “[something]”, that is, an in-game object, instead of an
abstract topic.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Quizzing it about is an action applying to two things. Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [something]&quot; and &quot;quiz [someone] about [something]&quot; as quizzing it about.\n\nCheck quizzing it about:\n\tsay &quot;[The noun] shrugs unhelpfully.&quot;\n\nInforming it about is an action applying to two things.

Understand "ask [someone] about [something]" and "quiz [someone] about [something]" as quizzing it about.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check quizzing it about:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] shrugs unhelpfully."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Informing it about is an action applying to two things. Understand "tell [someone] about [something]" and "inform [someone] about [something]" as informing it about.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check informing it about:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'That's interesting,' [the noun] says, stifling a yawn."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of quizzing Troy about the tuxedo:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'Oh, you've noticed my tuxedo,' he replies. 'I'm rather fond of it.'"</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that we’ve changed the Instead rule so that it now applies to
the quizzing it about action, not to the built-in asking it about
action. Now the player can ask and tell any character about any object
in the model world, and use or not use THE in the input.</p>

<p>But there’s still one big limitation we have to be aware of: The
grammar token “[something]” will only match things that are visible in
the room &ndash; that is, objects that are in scope. If we want to be able to
ask and tell characters about objects that are not present, we need to
change “[something]” in the grammar for our new actions to “[any
thing]”. We also need to change the definitions of our actions so that
instead of applying to two things, they apply to one thing and one
visible thing.</p>

<p>The reason for the latter change may not be obvious, but if you try
editing your code to refer to “[any thing]” but don’t change “thing” to
“visible thing”, you’ll see that the action doesn’t work properly.
<strong>Important concept:</strong> Technically, “a thing” is shorthand
for “a currently visible, touchable thing”. That’s what you’ll be typing
most often, so Inform lets you save a little typing. But when you say
“visible thing,” Inform understands that you’re referring to something
that’s visible somewhere or other in the world, whether or not it’s
touchable. This may seem backwards, because &ndash; well, it <em>is</em>
backwards.</p>

<p>Here are the final versions of our new actions:</p>

<div class="codeblock" id="Ref_any_topic"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`<span id=&quot;Ref_any_topic&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;></span>Quizzing it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.\n Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [any thing]&quot; and &quot;quiz [someone] about [any thing]&quot; as\nquizzing it about.\n\nInforming it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible\nthing. Understand &quot;tell [someone] about [any thing]&quot; and &quot;inform\n[someone] about [any thing]&quot; as informing it about.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Quizzing it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "ask [someone] about [any thing]" and "quiz [someone] about [any thing]" as</div>
<div class="codeline">quizzing it about.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Informing it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible</div>
<div class="codeline">thing. Understand "tell [someone] about [any thing]" and "inform</div>
<div class="codeline">[someone] about [any thing]" as informing it about.</div>
</div>

<p>Using this code, we can let the player ask characters about any
object in the model world. We can also create, if we like, offstage
things that can be used for conversation. These things don’t need to be
anywhere in the model world, and they don’t need any properties other
than their vocabulary:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Weather is a thing. Understand &quot;clouds&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;, and &quot;wind&quot; as\nweather.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Weather is a thing. Understand "clouds", "rain", and "wind" as</div>
<div class="codeline">weather.</div>
</div>

<p>But the idea of talking to an NPC about something that’s not in scope
raises a new complication: What if the NPC has never seen the object and
thus knows nothing about it? For that matter, what if the player
character has never seen the object (or at least, not in this particular
run-through of your game) and thus doesn’t officially know that it
exists? To deal with these questions, we need a way to track characters’
  knowledge.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there’s already an extension package that does some of
the heavy lifting for us. Now that you’ve learned the basics of how to
create an ask/tell/give/show conversation system, you can forget about
the details unless you happen to need them for some reason. Download and install
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Conversation%20Responses-v7.i7x">Conversation Responses by Eric Eve</a>. This extension provides a
simpler way to write conversation topics. It also lets you write
greetings and farewells.</p>

<p>I also like <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Conversational%20Defaults-v3.i7x">Eric Eve’s Conversational Defaults</a> (which requires
<a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Conversation%20Framework-v12.i7x">Conversation Framework by Eric Eve</a>, so you’ll need to download and install that too,
along with <a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Eric%20Eve/Epistemology.i7x">Epistemology by Eric Eve</a>, which tracks what the player
character knows about). Conversational Defaults makes it easier to set
up default responses, which will be printed out in the game when you
haven’t written a response for a specific ask or tell action. With only
a little effort, you can use Conversational Defaults to make your
characters seem somewhat more lifelike than if the player only
encountered the standard line, “There is no reply.” With Conversational
Defaults, we can give an NPC a bunch of possible outputs when he or she
doesn’t have a real response, and instruct Inform to select a response
at random. Here’s a short sample game that shows how to do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Conversational Defaults by Eric Eve.\n\nThe Test Lab is a room. The description is &quot;Many devious tests are conducted here.&quot;\n\nThe zombie is a man in the Lab. &quot;There&apos;s a dead guy sort of standing here. A zombie, from the look of him.&quot; The description is &quot;The zombie looks really ill. Really, really ill.&quot; Understand &quot;dead&quot;, &quot;guy&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, and &quot;ill&quot; as the zombie.\n\ndefault ask-tell response for the zombie:\n\tsay &quot;[one of]The zombie shrugs minimally[or]The zombie scratches his cheek and grunts unintelligibly[or]&apos;I can&apos;t remember hardly anything,&apos; the zombie says[or]The zombie only leers at you menacingly for a moment before sliding back into his usual morose lethargy[at random].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Include Conversational Defaults by Eric Eve.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Test Lab is a room. The description is "Many devious tests are conducted here."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The zombie is a man in the Lab. "There's a dead guy sort of standing here. A zombie, from the look of him." The description is "The zombie looks really ill. Really, really ill." Understand "dead", "guy", "man", and "ill" as the zombie.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">default ask-tell response for the zombie:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]The zombie shrugs minimally[or]The zombie scratches his cheek and grunts unintelligibly[or]'I can't remember hardly anything,' the zombie says[or]The zombie only leers at you menacingly for a moment before sliding back into his usual morose lethargy[at random]."</div>
</div>

<p>The effect we’re creating above &ndash; having the zombie give a variety of
different “non-responses” when asked or told about something for which
the author hasn’t written a real response &ndash; goes a long way toward
  making an NPC seem a bit more real.</p>

<p>If your story needs a lot of conversation, you might also want to
consider the extension <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Chris%20Conley/Threaded%20Conversation-v9.i7x">Threaded Conversation by Chris Conley</a>. This is a
complex and sophisticated package based on earlier work by Emily Short.
Among other things, it provides a method for the author to suggest
topics of conversation to the player during the story, in a smooth and
context-sensitive way. For instance, the story might suggest, “You could
ask Dave about the lighthouse or the police van.” After the player has
asked Dave about the lighthouse, it would disappear from the
suggestions, leaving only the police van &ndash; unless some new topic had
been revealed by Dave’s reply about the lighthouse, in which case the
next conversation prompt might be, “You could ask about the police van
or the flying reptiles.”</p>

<h3 id="conversations-part-iii-character-knowledge">Conversations, Part III: Character Knowledge</h3>

<p>During the course of a game, an NPC might learn something, and what
the NPC knows might change how he or she responds during a conversation.
For instance, let’s suppose the PC has witnessed Aunt Mary’s house
burning down, and is now in conversation (in a different location) with
Uncle Jack. Uncle Jack won’t know about the fire until the player tells
him &ndash; so the command ASK JACK ABOUT MARY might need two different
outputs, depending on whether or not Uncle Jack knows that Aunt Mary is
now without a home.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Eric%20Eve/Epistemology.i7x">Epistemology by Eric Eve</a> won’t take care of this
for us, because it’s intended to track what the PC knows, not what an
NPC knows. In this example, though, we’re going to use Conversation
Responses by Eric Eve. Conversation Responses includes Epistemology,
which is convenient for this example, because the player can’t ASK JACK
ABOUT MARY unless the player has previously seen or is familiar with the
Aunt Mary object. Both the “seen” and “familiar” properties are defined
in Epistemology.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now Jack-knows-about-fire is true.</div>
</div>

<p>In this example I’ve created Jack-knows-about-fire as a truth state
that varies. In a game where the software needs to keep track of an
NPC’s knowledge on a variety of subjects, keeping the data in a table
(see <a href="#tables">Tables</a>) might be easier.</p>

<p>If you study this code for a minute, the way it works should become
clear. The player can ask or tell Jack about the fire. The player can
either ask or tell Jack about Mary. These conversations test whether
Jack-knows-about-fire is true. If it’s false, Jack’s response is
different. If the player tries asking Jack about the fire before Jack
knows about it, Jack will ask for more information.</p>

<h3 id="conversations-part-iv-menu-based-conversation">Conversations, Part IV: Menu-Based Conversation</h3>

<p>In a menu-based conversation, the player who starts talking with an
NPC is presented with a menu of options, and selects one of the
responses by number. The output might look something like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>talk to madelyn</div>

<p>You could:</p>

<p>[1] compliment Madelyn on her hair.</p>

<p>[2] complain that the gunfire in the street kept you awake all
night.</p>

<p>[3] ask Madelyn why Uncle Jack was sent to prison.</p>

<p>[4] say goodbye.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>1</div>

<p>“You have really lovely hair,” you tell Madelyn.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” she replies, patting a stray strand into place.
“I’m not sure avocado green is really a good color on me.”</p>
</div>

<p>By typing a “1” at the prompt, the player selects the first item in
the conversation menu. What usually happens is that after the output of
item 1 is printed, the menu comes back again, but now with item 1
removed. Eventually, there will be nothing left in the menu except “say
goodbye.” The player will select that item, read the output, and the
conversation is finished.</p>

<p>One advantage of this type of conversation system is that it can read
in a more realistic way than bare commands like TELL MADELYN ABOUT HAIR
and ASK MADELYN ABOUT UNCLE JACK. Another advantage is that the player
is automatically directed toward topics of conversation that may be
interesting or important to the story. But there are two problems.
First, setting up this type of conversation system is not quite as easy
as creating an ask/tell system. Second, the player will most likely just
go through all of the possible topics one by one to see what they say.
This process is called “the lawnmower effect,” because it turns the
game-play into a rather boring mechanical process of mowing down
everything on the menu.</p>

<p>If you look in <a href="../RB_7.html#section_8">RB 7.8,
“Saying Complicated Things”</a>, you’ll find several examples of
conversational systems. <a href="../examples/sweeney.html">Example 282, “Sweeney”</a>, provides a hybrid system
in which the player can ask or tell about topics, but will sometimes be
prompted with a numbered list of items. The Recipe Book doesn’t give an
example of a full menu-based conversation system, reporting that “they
can be long-winded to set up, and therefore none are exemplified here,
but several have been released as extensions for Inform.” <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Michael%20Martin/Quip-Based%20Conversation-v5.i7x">Quip-Based Conversation by Michael Martin</a> is an example of this approach.</p>

<h3 id="giving-orders-to-characters">Giving Orders to Characters</h3>

<p>The standard command that players can use to give orders to NPCs is
in the form BOB, EAT THE PANCAKE. The NPC’s name is what grammarians
call a “noun of address,” and is followed by a comma. If you want your
game to respond to the alternate forms ASK BOB TO EAT THE PANCAKE and
TELL BOB TO EAT THE PANCAKE, one easy way to do it is with an “after
reading a command” rule. This type of rule intercepts the player’s input
before it reaches the parser. You can change the player’s input in
whatever way you like. This could be a sneaky way of creating an
infuriatingly difficult puzzle, but here we’ll use it in a more friendly
way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command:\n\tlet T be text;\n\tlet T be the player&apos;s command;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;tell bob to&quot; in T with &quot;bob,&quot;;\n\treplace the regular expression &quot;ask bob to&quot; in T with &quot;bob,&quot;;\n\tchange the text of the player&apos;s command to T.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be text;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be the player's command;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "tell bob to" in T with "bob,";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "ask bob to" in T with "bob,";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;change the text of the player's command to T.</div>
</div>

<p>The main thing to be aware of here is that if your NPC can be
referred to as “Bob”, “Uncle Bob”, “Uncle”, or “man”, the After Reading
a Command rule needs to process <em>all</em> of those possible inputs
separately, because the parser hasn’t yet had a chance to figure out
what object the player’s command is referring to. The words “man” and
“woman” will be especially sticky, because you might have several
different NPCs in your game that can be referred to as “man” or
“woman”.</p>

<p>Inform won’t let you rewrite the rule so that it reads “After reading
a command in the presence of Bob”. But you can do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command:\n\tlet T be text;\n\tlet T be the player&apos;s command;\n\tif Bob is in the location:\n\t\treplace the regular expression &quot;tell bob to&quot; in T with &quot;bob,&quot;;\n\t\treplace the regular expression &quot;ask bob to&quot; in T with &quot;bob,&quot;;\n\t\treplace the regular expression &quot;tell man to&quot; in T with &quot;man,&quot;;\n\t\t[&hellip;and so on for any other words that can refer to Bob&hellip;]\n\tchange the text of the player&apos;s command to T.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be text;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be the player's command;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Bob is in the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "tell bob to" in T with "bob,";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "ask bob to" in T with "bob,";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "tell man to" in T with "man,";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;and so on for any other words that can refer to Bob&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;change the text of the player's command to T.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player can give orders to an NPC using a variety of normal
phrases. But there’s a better way, which was suggested by Emily Short.
This uses Inform’s ability to match regular expressions &ndash; frankly not a
topic that belongs in a handbook for new authors. (If you’re curious,
have a look at <a href="../WI_20.html#section_6">WI 20.6 Regular expression matching</a>. The code below will handle giving orders
to all of the characters in your game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command: \n\tlet N be  text; \n\tlet N be the player&apos;s command; \n\treplace the regular expression &quot;\b(ask|tell|order) (.+?) to (.+)&quot; in N with &quot;\2, \3&quot;; \n\tchange the text of the player&apos;s command to N. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be  text; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be the player's command; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the regular expression "\b(ask|tell|order) (.+?) to (.+)" in N with "\2, \3"; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;change the text of the player's command to N. </div>
</div>

<p>But by default, NPCs will refuse to follow orders. If you want an NPC
to obey the player, you need to write a <strong>persuasion
rule</strong>, as explained in <a href="../WI_12.html#section_4">WI 12.4: Persuasion</a>. A persuasion rule can be as specific or
as broad as you like &ndash; you can have all NPCs obey orders, or only have
one NPC obey one specific order. Here’s how to do it with two specific
actions. We’re going to allow Uncle Jack to take the jewels or give them
to the player:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Persuasion rule for asking Uncle Jack to try taking the jewels:\n\tpersuasion succeeds.\nPersuasion rule for asking Uncle Jack to try giving the jewels to the player:\n\tpersuasion succeeds.\n\nInstead of Uncle Jack giving the jewels to the player:\n\tnow the player carries the jewels;\n\tsay &quot;Jack hands you the jewels.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Persuasion rule for asking Uncle Jack to try taking the jewels:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;persuasion succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">Persuasion rule for asking Uncle Jack to try giving the jewels to the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;persuasion succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of Uncle Jack giving the jewels to the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the jewels;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Jack hands you the jewels.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>This code assumes that the jewels are in scope. (Perhaps Uncle Jack
is already carrying them.) If you need an NPC to give the player
something that has only been talked about, but that isn’t in the room at
the moment, you have a slightly more complex problem. The easy way to
deal with this is to have the NPC carry the object, but make it a
concealed possession, as explained in <a href="../WI_3.html#section_24">WI 3.24 Concealment</a>:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. Troy carries a banana.\n\nRule for deciding the concealed possessions of Troy: if the particular possession is the banana, yes; otherwise no.\n\nPersuasion rule for asking Troy to try giving the banana to the player:\n\tpersuasion succeeds.\n\nInstead of Troy giving the banana to the player:\n\tsay &quot;Troy gives you the banana.&quot;;\n\tnow the player carries the banana;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Troy is a man in the Billiard Room. Troy carries a banana.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Troy: if the particular possession is the banana, yes; otherwise no.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Persuasion rule for asking Troy to try giving the banana to the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;persuasion succeeds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of Troy giving the banana to the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Troy gives you the banana.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the banana;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>When the banana is concealed, the player won’t be able to X BANANA,
but the banana will still be in scope, so TROY, GIVE ME THE BANANA will
work as expected.</p>

<h3 id="giving-orders-that-involve-going-elsewhere">Giving Orders that Involve Going Elsewhere</h3>

<p>At times, you might want the player to be able to give an NPC an
order that requires going somewhere else and doing something there. The
basic difficulty in this case is, in effect, that once the NPC has gone
somewhere else, he or she can’t “hear” the player character. A secondary
difficulty, which will arise once we solve the first one, is that when
the NPC is carrying out an action in a different location, the parser
will report it to the player, even though the NPC is invisible. The
solution to the latter requires the extension called <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Ron%20Newcomb/Scope%20Control-v2.i7x">Scope Control by
Ron Newcomb</a>. (Ron also contributed to the development of this
example.)</p>

<p>Here’s a simple game in which the player can order Jeeves the butler
to go somewhere else and do something &ndash; specifically, go north, get the
cheese, and then go south again.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Scope Control by Ron Newcomb. \n\nThe Dining Room is a room.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with "Jeeves, n then get cheese then s then give me the cheese". </div>
</div>

<p>In a real game, we probably wouldn’t want to use such a sweeping
persuasion rule. The variable called “the subject” is changed to Jeeves
when the player gives Jeeves an order. Then the subject is placed in
scope. As a result, Jeeves will “hear” all of the orders even when he’s
in a different room. The two last rules (Unsuccessful attempt and Before
answering someone) prevent Jeeves’ actions from being reported if he’s
in a different room.</p>

<h3 id="moving-characters-around">Moving Characters Around</h3>

<p>People don’t always stay in one place. In the real world, people do
sometimes stay put for long periods of time &ndash; for instance, the
librarian sitting behind her desk, who won’t leave for hours. Other
times, though, people move from one place to another. There are several
ways to imitate that behavior in interactive fiction.</p>

<p>A classic effect in the early days of IF was to have an NPC wander at
random around the map. This isn’t very realistic, because people usually
have reasons for going places, but at least it adds a little variety to
the game. An example of an NPC who might be expected to behave this way
would be a butler moving from room to room in a large mansion.</p>

<p>In the simple example below, we’ll create a square 3x3 grid of rooms
and then create an NPC who wanders at random. If you can’t tell from the
code what the map will look like, switch to the Index World tab after
compiling the game.</p></div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let D be a random direction;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try Bob going D.</div>
</div>

<p>As a result of the Every Turn rule, Bob will try going some direction
or other in every turn, but if no room exists in the random direction,
the “try” statement will fail. Bob will stay where he is. If the player
is in a room when Bob arrives, the game will report the fact. Likewise,
if Bob and the player are in the same room, the game will report when
Bob succeeds in leaving. The output might look like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Room 5</p>

<p>You can see Bob here.</p>

<p>Bob goes south.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>z</div>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>z</div>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>Bob arrives from the south.</p>
</div>

<p>This is okay as far as it goes, but the outputs (“Bob goes south” and
“Bob arrives from the south”) are not very interesting. If you turn on
rules reporting using the RULES command, you’ll learn that these outputs
are coming from the “describe room gone into rule.” You can’t find this
rule by searching <em>Writing with Inform</em>. Nor is it visible in the
Index Rules area. However, you can find it by going to File/Open
Extension/Graham Nelson/Standard Rules. It’s more than 60 lines
long.</p>

<p>Replacing the entire rule would require quite a bit of tinkering; I
wouldn’t want to try it, because I’d probably end up adding bugs. If all
we really want is to make your characters’ arrivals and departures a
little more interesting, here’s a simple way to do it. Note that this
doesn’t handle complex situations, such as when the NPC is in a
vehicle.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Report someone (called the traveler) going:\n\tif the traveler is in the location:\n\t\tsay &quot;[one of]Here comes old [actor] again[or][The actor] saunters up to you[or]The ominous creaking of floorboards announces the arrival of [the actor][at random].&quot; instead;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;[one of]At the sound of a thin scream in the distance, [the actor] dashes away[or]You suddenly notice that [the actor] has wandered off somewhere[or][The actor] evaporates in a thin puff of acrid smoke[at random].&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Report someone (called the traveler) going:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the traveler is in the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]Here comes old [actor] again[or][The actor] saunters up to you[or]The ominous creaking of floorboards announces the arrival of [the actor][at random]." instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]At the sound of a thin scream in the distance, [the actor] dashes away[or]You suddenly notice that [the actor] has wandered off somewhere[or][The actor] evaporates in a thin puff of acrid smoke[at random]." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>This code doesn’t tell the player which direction the character
arrives from or departs to; that would require more tinkering. But now
we have a way to add a little variety to the output.</p>

<p><a href="../RB_7.html#section_13">RB 7.13</a> provides
several examples of different ways to move NPCs around. Possibly the
most interesting of these is shown in <a href="../examples/latris_theon.html">Example 185, “Latris Theon”</a>.
Inform includes a path-finding algorithm &ndash; a built-in procedure that
will allow an NPC to calculate the best route from his or her current
location to any other location. Applying this to the example given
earlier is not difficult: Replace the last two blocks (“Bob is in Room
3” and the Every Turn rule) with the following code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Bob is a man in Room 3. The destination of Bob is Room 3. Persuasion rule for asking Bob to try going vaguely: persuasion succeeds.\n\nEvery turn when the destination of Bob is not the location of Bob:\n\tlet the right direction be the best route from the location of Bob to the destination of Bob;\n\ttry Bob going the right direction.\n\nA person has a room called destination.\n\nUnderstand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as going vaguely.\n\nGoing vaguely is an action applying to one visible thing.\n\nCarry out someone going vaguely: \n    change the destination of the person asked to the noun.\n\nReport someone going vaguely: \n    say &quot;[The person asked] looks amused, but accepts the commission to go to [the noun].&quot;\n\nCarry out going vaguely: \n    say &quot;You&apos;re too thoroughly lost.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Bob is a man in Room 3.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the destination of Bob is not the location of Bob:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the right direction be the best route from the location of Bob to the destination of Bob;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try Bob going the right direction.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A person has a room called destination.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "go to [any room]" as going vaguely.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Going vaguely is an action applying to one visible thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out someone going vaguely: </div>
<div class="codeline">    change the destination of the person asked to the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report someone going vaguely: </div>
<div class="codeline">    say "[The person asked] looks amused, but accepts the commission to go to [the noun]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out going vaguely: </div>
<div class="codeline">    say "You're too thoroughly lost."</div>
</div>

<p>We’ve done a few new things here. First, “A person has a room called
destination.” Since Bob is a person, he now has a destination. Initially
we make his destination Room 3, so he’s happy to stay where he is. He’s
no longer going to wander around at random. Next, we include a
persuasion rule, so that Bob will respond to an order to go vaguely.
(The persuasion rule will cause BOB, GO TO ROOM 7 to work the way we’d
like it to.) The rest of the new code is directly copied from “Latris
Theon.”</p>

<p>Notice also the difference between the two Carry Out rules. One
applies to <em>someone</em> going vaguely (in other words, not the
player character), while the other applies to the PC.</p>

<p><a href="../examples/odyssey.html">Example 274, “Odyssey”</a> is in the same section of the <em>Recipe
Book</em>. This shows how to move an NPC along a route that we’ve
created in advance. The NPC’s travel will be interrupted temporarily if
the player chooses to interact with her. One refinement I’d suggest
adding to this example, if you try it out, would be to define a scene
called Athena Traveling. (See <a
href="#scenes">Scenes</a> and <a href="../WI_10.html">Chapter 10 of <em>Writing with Inform</em>, Scenes</a>.)
I would then change the Every Turn rule like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn when Athena Traveling is happening:\n\tif Athena is active:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn when Athena Traveling is happening:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Athena is active:</div>
</div>

<p>This will allow you to keep Athena (or whatever NPC you’re using) in
one place until some specific event occurs. For instance, you might do
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Athena Traveling is a scene. Athena Traveling begins when the player\ncarries the laurel wreath.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Athena Traveling is a scene. Athena Traveling begins when the player</div>
<div class="codeline">carries the laurel wreath.</div>
</div>

<p>Now Athena will stay put (perhaps lurking in her temple) until the
player picks up the laurel wreath. When that happens, she’ll set out on
  her journey.</p>

<p>The extension called <a href="https://github.com/i7/archive/blob/master/Michael%20Callaghan/Patrollers.i7x">Patrollers by Michael Callaghan</a> provides some
extra tools with which to write NPCs who move from place to place.</p>

<h3 id="characters-who-follow-the-player">Characters Who Follow the Player</h3>

<p>Writing a character who will find the player and then follow the
player around like a faithful puppy is not difficult. <a href="../examples/van_helsing.html">Example 39, “Van
Helsing”</a> (again from <a href="../RB_7.html#section_13">RB 7.13</a>)
shows how to do it. We can adapt this code slightly to the example above
by getting rid of the code that allows the player to order Bob around,
replacing it with this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Bob is a man in Room 3.\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif the location of Bob is not the location of the player:\n\t\tlet the way be the best route from the location of Bob to the location of the player;\n\t\ttry Bob going the way;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;&apos;Hey, I&apos;m bored,&apos; Bob says. &apos;Let&apos;s go for a ramble.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Bob is a man in Room 3.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the location of Bob is not the location of the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the way be the best route from the location of Bob to the location of the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try Bob going the way;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'Hey, I'm bored,' Bob says. 'Let's go for a ramble.'"</div>
</div>

<p>The same suggestion I gave for the “Odyssey” example (just above)
applies here. You probably don’t want Bob following the player from the
very beginning of the game. To make Bob behave in a way that fits your
story, you would need to define a Scene, and then say “Every turn when
Too-Friendly-Bob is happening”. Then write a sentence that defines when
Too-Friendly-Bob begins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Emily%20Short/Simple%20Followers-v7.i7x">Simple Followers by Emily Short</a> provides easy
ways to create NPCs who will follow the player (or other NPCs) and will
start or stop following on command. However, this extension doesn’t work
the other way: it doesn’t let the player follow characters who have left
the room.</p>

<h3 id="characters-the-player-can-follow">Characters the Player Can Follow</h3>

<p>There are at least two ways (and maybe more) to set up a game so that
the player needs to follow another character. First, the NPC may be
standing in the room, saying, “Come on, follow me!” or something of the
sort, in which case the command FOLLOW BOB would likely be implemented
so as to move both the PC and the NPC to whatever room the NPC has in
mind. Second, the NPC may just have left the room, and the player may
now be wanting to follow the NPC to see whither he is bound.</p>

<p>The second situation is trickier than the first. This is because of
the way Inform handles scope. As explained in the <a
href="#Ref_scope">previous discussion of scope</a>, the player can normally only refer to objects
that are in the same room (and also visible &ndash; an object in a closed
container is invisible, for instance, unless the container is
transparent). If the NPC has left the room, he won’t be in scope, so
FOLLOW BOB will produce the unhelpful output “You can’t see any such
thing.” Well, duh &ndash; that was why I wanted to follow him!</p>

<p><a href="../examples/actaeon.html">Example 302, “Actaeon”</a> (from <a href="../RB_7.html#section_13">RB 7.13</a>), shows how to allow the PC to follow an NPC who
has left the room. This example is easy to customize, but it’s worth
including some of the code here to point out a couple of features. We’ll
start with the setup from <a href="#Ref_boring_bob">Boring Bob</a>, in which
Bob is meandering around a featureless grid of nine rooms. This time,
though, we’ll start him in Room 1, so the player can start following him
immediately.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the pawn to the target.</div>
</div>

<p>If you look at the Every Turn rule here, or just try it out in a test
game, you’ll find that Bob moves to a new room in every turn. In the
examples earlier in this chapter, Bob would choose a random direction
every turn &ndash; but if there was no room in that direction, he wouldn’t
move. The line above, “let next location be a random room which is
adjacent to the current location;” causes Bob to choose a random room
that actually exists, and move to it.</p>

<p>We have to move Bob in a tidy way, or “tidily” (an ugly word, but
useful), so that he’ll keep track of where he was last.</p>

<p>If you comment out the last line in the Check Following rule, the
player will be able to follow Bob even after several turns have elapsed.
The result may turn out to be slightly unrealistic, however, because the
PC won’t necessarily take the route that Bob took. Instead, the PC will
choose the best route to wherever Bob happens to be <em>now.</em> If Bob
has traveled around to the other side of the map &ndash; if he left heading
south but is now in a room to the north &ndash; this code will cause the PC to
go north, which is rather odd, and doesn’t accord well with the meaning
of the word “follow.” That’s probably why the original code in this
example only allows the follow command to be used immediately after the
NPC has left the room. Storing an NPC’s entire route, so as to allow the
player to follow (perhaps by tracking footprints or dropped breadcrumbs)
would be a lot more work, and would probably be unrealistic unless the
NPC is leaving a trail of breadcrumbs, so we’ll leave it as a coding
challenge for advanced Inform authors.</p>

<h3 id="stage-business">Stage Business</h3>

<p>A character will seem more “alive” if she spontaneously does things
on her own, or seems to. Sometimes the character will do something that
changes the model world (see “Character Actions,” below). But sometimes
we just want to print out a reminder to the player &ndash; a message that
doesn’t actually do anything, but that makes the scene seem more lively.
I call these reminder messages “stage business.”</p>

<p>In this example, Janice is the maid. She will seem to do something
without really doing anything:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Living Room is a room. &quot;This fussy old-fashioned living room is filled with heavy furniture.&quot;\n\nJanice is a woman in the Living Room. &quot;Janice is busy tidying up.&quot; The description is &quot;Janice is wearing a maid&apos;s uniform.

"This fussy old-fashioned living room is filled with heavy furniture."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Janice is a woman in the Living Room. "Janice is busy tidying up." The description is "Janice is wearing a maid's uniform. She's bustling about, doing all sorts of things."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the player is in the Living Room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Janice [one of]flicks dust off of the grand piano[or]runs the vacuum cleaner[or]plumps up the cushions on the sofa[or]straightens a painting[or]polishes the mirror above the mantel[at random]."</div>
</div>

<p>The Every Turn rule will only run when the player is in the room with
Janice. (If Janice were moving around the house, we’d need to change
this rule a bit). About 1/3 of the time, a random message will be
printed indicating that Janice is busy doing her job.</p>

<h3 id="character-actions">Character Actions</h3>

<p>A good way to make a character seem more alive is for the character
to react in some way when the player does something. This reaction could
range from a simple comment to an explosive act.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose that old Alexander Button seems to be asleep in his
chair. But he isn’t asleep, really. If you pick up the piece of paper on
the table, he’ll snatch it away from you:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Alexander Button is a man in the Living Room. &quot;Old Alexander [if Alexander carries the will]eyes you keenly[otherwise]seems to be asleep[end if].&quot; The description is &quot;He must be at least 90[if Alexander carries the will].

"Old Alexander [if Alexander carries the will]eyes you keenly[otherwise]seems to be asleep[end if]." The description is "He must be at least 90[if Alexander carries the will]. He's wide awake, and looking at you in a doubtful way[otherwise]. He seems to be asleep[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The end table is a scenery supporter in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The will is on the end table. The description is "A legal-looking piece of paper. You can't read what's on it, because it's upside down."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now Alexander carries the will;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Alexander's eyes fly open. 'So &hellip; snooping, eh?' He snatches the will away from you."</div>
</div>

<p>To get Alexander to react, we use an After rule. An After rule is a
good idea here, because it allows Inform to do its usual processing of
the TAKE PAPER command. Only if the command succeeds &ndash; if it’s possible
for the player to take the will &ndash; will Alexander react.</p>

<p>The NPC action above was triggered by a taking action. Sometimes, we
may want a character to react to something he or she sees. For instance,
the character might demand that the player give him an object the player
is carrying. Here’s a short game that shows how this might work<span

<p>In this example, the work is being done by the Every Turn rule and
the Instead Of Going rule. The player can do anything in the saloon (in
a real game, this might include ordering a drink or sitting down to play
poker, actions that would likely cause the sheriff to become more and
more insistent), but can’t leave until he has given the gun to the
sheriff.</p>

<h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>

<p>I’ve never used the extension called Armed by David Ratliff, but a
couple of my students have found it useful. The version on the Inform 7
website doesn’t work with current versions of Inform, as it was written
in 2008. Fixing it is not terribly difficult. The phrase “end the game”
has to be changed to “end the story”, instances of “change … to” have to
be changed to “now … is”, and you may want to fix a misspelled word or
two. The biggest stumbling block is that one of the Check rules in
Armed, called the can’t take it with you rule, uses the word “ignore”.
This feature is no longer supported. I was able to work around the
problem by replacing that rule with this new code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check an actor taking (this is the new can&apos;t take people&apos;s possessions rule):\n\tlet the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;\n\tlet the owner be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;\n\twhile the owner is not nothing and the owner is not the local ceiling:\n\t\tif the owner is a person and the owner is not dead:\n\t\t\tif the actor is the player:\n\t\t\t\tsay &quot;[regarding the noun][Those] [seem] to belong to [the owner].&quot; (A);\n\t\t\tstop the action;\n\t\tlet the owner be the not-counting-parts holder of the owner;\n\nThe new can&apos;t take people&apos;s possessions rule is listed instead of the can&apos;t take people&apos;s possessions rule in the check taking rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check an actor taking (this is the new can't take people's possessions rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the owner be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while the owner is not nothing and the owner is not the local ceiling:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the owner is a person and the owner is not dead:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the actor is the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[regarding the noun][Those] [seem] to belong to [the owner]." (A);</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the owner be the not-counting-parts holder of the owner;</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The new can't take people's possessions rule is listed instead of the can't take people's possessions rule in the check taking rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>In case you’re curious, I created this code by copying the original
can’t take people’s possessions rule in Standard Rules and adding the
words “and the owner is not dead” to line 5.</p>

<p>Armed creates several kinds of weapons, allows you to set the maximum
amount of damage that will be inflicted by a weapon, and computes the
health of each character based on the amount of damage they’ve suffered.
If you only want to add some weapons to your game, it might be easier to
do it yourself, because Armed prints out the health of each character
when the character is examined, and the health of the player character
when the player takes inventory. If most of your game doesn’t involve
combat, the printout of characters’ health is likely to be a bit
distracting.</p>

<p>If all you need to do is set up one encounter in which some combat
takes place, here’s some code that will get you started. Note that we
need to create an action called “attacking it with”. Inform’s standard
library includes attacking, but not attacking it with. In the code
below, we’ve set it up so that if the player tries ATTACK THE DUKE
without naming a weapon, we don’t get Inform’s default response,
“Violence isn’t the answer to this one.” Since violence <em>is</em> the
answer to this one, it’s important not to confuse the player.</p>

<h3 id="moods">Moods</h3>

<p>Real people can get into a variety of moods &ndash; friendly, bored,
hostile, romantic, frightened, twitchy, and so on. The extension Mood
Variations by Emily Short provides an easy way to switch characters from
one mood to another in the course of conversation. It’s meant to be used
with a conversation package such as Eric Eve’s Conversation Framework,
but you don’t need to actually use the features in Conversation
Framework or Conversation Responses if you don’t want to; you just need
to include one of them so that Mood Variations can make use of a
variable called the current interlocutor. Mood Variations is set up to
make it easy to switch a character’s mood in the course of conversation,
using the syntax “[set hostile]” within a quote. This will always set
the mood of the person the player is currently talking to. To change a
character’s mood outside of quotes, you need to write something like,
“now the current mood of Bob is hostile”.</p>

<p>Here’s a short game, which makes not a bit of sense, but may give you
a quick idea of what’s possible if you include Mood Variations. The
“asked-or-told about” syntax is defined in Conversation Responses.
Notice that the first thing we do is define a list of moods. This will
include all of the moods that <em>any</em> character can get into in the
game. We don’t create a separate list of moods for each character.</p>

<h3 id="body-parts">Body Parts</h3>

<p>Giving your characters body parts is not always necessary, but if the
character’s description mentions something prominently (Janet’s blue
eyes, the duke’s hawklike nose, or whatever), you can easily use
Inform’s ability to create parts of objects (as discussed in Chapter 3
of this <em>Handbook</em>) to make the body parts. In some games, you
might want to give all of your characters body parts. In this case, you
would make the part a kind of thing, like this:</p>

<p>The Living Room is a room.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Living Room is a room.\n\nA nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person. The description of a nose is usually &quot;Seen one nose, seen [&apos;]em all.&quot;\n\nSusan is a person in the Living Room.\nThe description of Susan&apos;s nose is &quot;It has a cute upward tilt.&quot; Understand &quot;cute&quot; as Susan&apos;s nose.\n\nThe description of your nose is &quot;You can&apos;t see much of it, as you&apos;re behind it.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Living Room is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person. The description of a nose is usually "Seen one nose, seen [']em all."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Susan is a person in the Living Room.</div>
<div class="codeline">The description of Susan's nose is "It has a cute upward tilt." Understand "cute" as Susan's nose.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The description of your nose is "You can't see much of it, as you're behind it."</div>
</div>

<p>The only odd thing about this is that you can’t say “The description
of the player’s nose”. Or rather, you can; it will compile; but it won’t
work. Instead, you have to say “your nose”. Inform will understand that
the player can then refer to this object as “my nose”.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6-puzzles">Chapter 6: Puzzles</h2>

<p>In the short section on puzzles in Chapter 1, I pointed out that a
few games are “puzzleless,” but that most games have a few puzzles, or a
lot of them. The point of including puzzles is that the player becomes a
sort of collaborator in the unfolding of the story. The story will only
move forward when the player takes some action.</p>

<p>Almost any sort of action might be required &ndash; watering a tiny plant,
for instance, might turn it into a giant beanstalk that can be climbed.
But possibly the most basic form of puzzle in IF is the locked door. The
player doesn’t yet have the key that unlocks the door, and has to hunt
for the key. Unlocking and opening the door will give the player access
to a new room, or perhaps to an entirely new region of the model world
containing dozens of rooms.</p>

<p>The way I look at it, every puzzle in every game, no matter what form
it might take, is ultimately not very different from a locked door. You
can’t see what’s on the other side until you find the key, whatever the
key is. What’s on the other side might be a physical location or a
series of new events. The “key” might be an apple that you need to give
to the wicked witch so she’ll go to sleep so you can rescue the children
in the oven. In some sense, the apple is a key, although the code you’ll
write to handle the command GIVE APPLE TO WITCH will probably look
somewhat different from the code for UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY.</p>

<p>In this chapter we’ll take a look at many of the common types of
puzzles, and suggest a few ways to implement them. This is not, I hasten
to add, a complete inventory of puzzle types. It’s intended merely to
introduce a few ideas that new IF writers may not have considered.</p>

<p>IF authors have written lots of essays and tips about puzzles.
Stephen Granade has a good short essay on <a
href="http://brasslantern.org/writers/iftheory/betterpuzzles-a.html">Making Better Puzzles</a>). Graham Nelson’s manual on programming
Inform 6, the <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/manual/html/contents.html"><em>Designer's Manual, 4th edition</em></a> (DM4), has a
very good section on <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s50.html">the design of puzzles</a>.
(In case you’re unfamiliar with Inform 6, perhaps I should add that
nothing else in the DM4 will be of much use to you as an Inform 7 author
&ndash; at least not until you start writing I6 inclusions, an advanced type
of programming not covered in this <em>Handbook.</em>)</p>

<p>I like to include some easy puzzles in a game, and a few hard ones.
But as a player, I prefer the easy ones, because I’m very bad at
puzzle-solving. While playing other people’s games, I often get stuck.
Many authors feel that it’s a good idea to help players by including
some form of hint system in the game. You’ll find some advice on how to
set up a hint system in <a href="#chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10, Advanced Topics</a>. Other authors feel that providing
hints spoils the game, or is just too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="mapping">Mapping</h3>

<p>Creating and maintaining a map that shows the layout of the game
isn’t much of a puzzle, but it definitely qualifies. The player who
neglects to create a pencilled map on which she notes that there’s a
south exit from the Library is quite likely to miss something important
in the game.</p>

<p>Many games today include a full list of available exits (or at least,
of the obvious exits ― see below) as part of the room description. In
some older games, this convention wasn’t adhered to: exits might not be
mentioned at all. Trying all of the available compass directions, only
to be told over and over, “You can’t go that way,” is not much fun,
which is why this type of puzzle isn’t much used anymore.</p>

<p>The classic example of a
mapping puzzle is a maze. A maze is a set of rooms (usually between ten
and fifty of them) in which the player can move freely, but in which
navigation is difficult for some reason. Most players don’t like mazes,
because mazes can be mind-numbingly repetitive to solve.</p>

<p>The original game of Adventure had two mazes. The room descriptions
within each maze were all identical (and no exits were listed), so just
LOOKing wouldn’t tell you where you were. The connections between rooms
in a maze is likely to be “twisty,” which means that if you go north
from room A and arrive in room B, going south from room B quite likely
won’t take you back to room A. Some room connections may even fold back
on themselves: When you go east from room A, you may end up back in room
A! This type of navigation system is easy to set up in Inform (see
“Twisty Connections” in Chapter 2 of the <em>Handbook</em>).</p>

<p>The time-honored way to map this type of maze is to drop an object in
each room as you go along. The pattern of dropped objects then allows
the player to differentiate the rooms from one another and work out the
navigational routes. If you put this type of maze in a modern game, it’s
safe to say you’ll amuse nobody. But there are many ways to make mazes
interesting (at least, they’ll be interesting to people who don’t mind
mazes). In “A Flustered Duck,” I included a maze that could only be
mapped while the player character is wearing a blindfold. When the
blindfold is not worn, the connections between rooms are entirely random
and the room descriptions are all identical &ndash; but when the PC is wearing
a blindfold, he can find distinct room connections using his sense of
touch.</p>

<h3 id="blocked-passageways">Blocked Passageways</h3>

<p>A locked door is obviously a type of blocked passageway. In “The
Craft of Adventure,” Graham Nelson observes, “Almost invariably games
close off sections of the map (temporarily) by putting them behind
locked doors, which the player can see and gnash her teeth over, but
cannot yet open. And almost every variation on this theme has been
tried: coded messages on the door, illusory defenses, gate-keepers, the
key being in the lock on the wrong side, and so on. Still, the usual
thing is simply to find a key in some fairly remote place, bring it to
the door, and open it.”</p>

<p>Quite often you’ll find several locked doors in a game, and several
keys. This can be at least mildly amusing, because the player usually
has the wrong key. Finding a good place to hide the key isn’t always
easy. Experienced players will try LOOK BEHIND and LOOK UNDER with any
object (such as a bed, painting, or rug) that looks as if it might
conceal a small object. You can also expect players to SEARCH anything
(such as a couch with cushions) that looks to be a likely place where
something might be hidden. For more on how to set this up, see Chapter
3, “Things.”</p>

<p>Popular variants on the locked door include chasms too wide to leap
across (with or without a bridge too flimsy to support your weight),
doors guarded by uncooperative characters who won’t let you pass (see
“The Uncooperative Character,” below), and secret doors. The secret door
appears not to be a door at all (see “Hidden Items,” below), so the
“unlocking” process is mainly a matter of finding the door.</p>

<p>The inventory-blocking passage is a related type. In this puzzle, you
can traverse a passageway freely ― but not while carrying certain items.
And of course, you’ll almost certainly need those items once you get to
the far side of the passageway, so this can also be considered an
inventory manipulation puzzle. A fiendish inventory-blocking passageway,
which (unless my memory is playing tricks on me) dates clear back to
“Adventure,” is a passage through which a powerful wind is blowing &ndash; a
wind that will blow out your lamp or candle. This puzzle is a cross
between the inventory-blocking passageway and the darkness puzzle (see
below).</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, however, that not all cases in which inventory
can’t be carried through a passage are puzzles. In some games, the
author chooses to manage the player’s inventory by making each area of
the map self-contained. Inventory items may be dropped automatically
when you use the passageway, or the passageway may remain blocked until
you get rid of what you’re carrying. (It may not always be obvious,
though perhaps it ought to be, whether the blockage is a puzzle or just
the author’s inventory management system at work.)</p>

<p>The ultimate blocked-passageway puzzle is a single room from which
there appears to be no exit at all (except perhaps a locked door to
which you lack the key). This room is often a prison cell, but other
variations are common. The solution may involve inspecting all of the
items in the room <em>very</em> carefully or conversing with someone who
is on the other side of the wall.</p>

<h3 id="darkness">Darkness</h3>

<p>The need to bring a light source into a dark room or rooms is a
puzzle that dates clear back to “Adventure,” which of course was set in
a system of caves (see 
href="#dark-rooms">Dark Rooms</a>). To solve a dark room puzzle, the player has
to find and carry an object that provides light. Today, most rooms in
most games are lighted by default, but dark rooms still show up in quite
a few games. The light source that’s needed may be unusual, or may last
for only a limited number of turns &ndash; a burning match, for instance &ndash;
making the dark room a timed puzzle. (See “Timed Puzzles,” below.)</p>

<p>A variant of the dark room puzzle is a dim room, in which you can see
some things, probably large ones, but not small things. You might be
unable to read written materials in the dim room, for instance.</p>

<p>Objects dropped in dark rooms can’t be picked up again. This fact
requires careful thought; it’s possible to make your game unwinnable
without meaning to &ndash; for instance if the player drops the matches in the
dark room before finding the candle. If you don’t want to allow the game
to become unwinnable, you’ll need to write a rule that will prevent this
from happening:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of dropping the candle:\n\tif the player is in a dark room:\n\t\tsay &quot;Better keep your hands on the candle for now. You may need it later.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of dropping the candle:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in a dark room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Better keep your hands on the candle for now. You may need it later.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="hidden-items">Hidden Items</h3>

<p>Experienced players of IF know to EXAMINE everything that’s mentioned
in the room description, or in a description of another object. So it’s
fair to tuck clues to various puzzles in descriptions. Quite often, the
room will contain an object which is itself scenery, but which will
reveal further details when examined. The description of a wall panel,
for instance, might suggest to the player that the panel is a secret
door. Or maybe the panel looks entirely innocent when examined, but if
the player examines the rug he’ll learn that a semicircular mark on the
rug curves out from the wall panel. (If you’re going to do that, be sure
to mention the rug in the room description.) The details are “hidden”
only in a technical sense, because you have to examine something else in
order to notice them, so this is only barely a puzzle. Many games that
award points don’t award any points for examining things, because the
action is just too easy and obvious.</p>

<p>Examining won’t always reveal hidden items, however. As a player,
you’ll want to get in the habit of looking under and behind anything
large. Containers may need to be searched in order to reveal what’s
hidden in them. By default, Inform will list the contents of any open
container when the player examines the container, but as an author you
might want to make the puzzle a tiny bit more difficult. If you do this,
though, it would be a courtesy to the player to provide a clue that more
action needs to be taken. Here’s a not very subtle example, in which
“almost anything might be buried down there” serves as a clue:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Living Room is a room. &quot;Your comfy living room.&quot;\n\nThe big old box is an open container in the living room.The description is &quot;It&apos;s just a big old box[one of] full of junk.

The description is &quot;A horrible mass of rusty old junk.&quot; Understand &quot;rusty&quot; as the junk.\n\nInstead of taking the junk:\n\tsay &quot;You have no need to burden yourself with a pile of old junk.&quot;\n\nThe jewel-encrusted bracelet is a thing. The description is &quot;Diamonds and sapphires and rubies, oh my!&quot;\n\nInstead of searching the box for the first time:\n\ttry searching the junk.\n\nInstead of searching the junk for the first time:\n\tsay &quot;Down among the rusty junk, you spot a priceless jewel-encrusted bracelet!&quot;;\n\tnow the bracelet is in the box.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Living Room is a room. "Your comfy living room."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The big old box is an open container in the living room.The description is "It's just a big old box[one of] full of junk. There's so much stuff that almost anything might be buried down there[or][stopping]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The pile of old junk is in the box. The description is "A horrible mass of rusty old junk." Understand "rusty" as the junk.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the junk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You have no need to burden yourself with a pile of old junk."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The jewel-encrusted bracelet is a thing. The description is "Diamonds and sapphires and rubies, oh my!"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of searching the box for the first time:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try searching the junk.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of searching the junk for the first time:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Down among the rusty junk, you spot a priceless jewel-encrusted bracelet!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the bracelet is in the box.</div>
</div>

<p>The result, when the game is played, looks like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Living Room</p>

<p>Your comfy living room.</p>

<p>You can see a big old box (in which is a pile of old junk) here.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x box</div>

<p>It's just a big old box full of junk. There's so much stuff that
almost anything might be buried down there.</p>

<p>In the big old box is a pile of old junk.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>look in box</div>

<p>Down among the rusty junk, you spot a priceless jewel-encrusted
bracelet!</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>x box</div>

<p>It's just a big old box.</p>

<p>In the big old box are a jewel-encrusted bracelet and a pile of old
junk.</p>
</div>

<p>The LOOK IN command causes the same action as SEARCH.</p>

<p>A sorting puzzle probably qualifies as a subtype of the hidden item
puzzle. In a sorting puzzle, there are a great many similar or seemingly
identical objects, all available at the same time. Your goal is to find
a way to distinguish the one you want from all of the others. For an
especially fiendish example of this, you might want to download and play
the game “69,105 Keys.” It’s a one-room game with a locked vault, and,
you guessed it, 69,105 keys, only one of which opens the vault.</p>


<h3 id="items-out-of-reach">Items Out of Reach</h3>

<p>Putting an important object on a high shelf or at the bottom of a
narrow hole, where the object can be seen but not touched, is a common
puzzle. The player may need to stand on a chair to reach the shelf, or
find a giant magnet on a rope to retrieve the iron key from the hold.
Sometimes the solution is to go around to an entirely different
location, from where the shelf or hole bottom is reachable. Sometimes
the solution is to shake the shelf so that what’s on it will fall
off.</p>

<h3 id="locked-containers">Locked Containers</h3>

<p>As with a locked door, the usual way to open a locked container is to
find the key. Sometimes the locked container has a glass door, so that
what’s in it can be seen but not reached. (The way to do this in Inform
is to make the container <em>transparent</em>. This word has a special
meaning to the compiler and the parser.) Once in a while the solution is
simply to break the container.</p>

<h3 id="combination-locks">Combination Locks</h3>

<p>Either a door or a locked container may have a combination lock
instead of a physical key. The most straightforward type of combination
lock puzzle is, perhaps literally, a combination lock. It may have a
single dial that needs to be turned to three or four numbers in
succession, or a row of dials each of which needs to be set to a
specific number. The number of possible combinations is likely to be
large, so the only practical way to solve the puzzle is to find the
piece of paper on which some thoughtful or absent-minded person has
scribbled down the combination.</p>

<p>A more interesting combination lock puzzle can be created by
scattering clues around. For instance, the dials might be of various
colors, and each dial might have a number of symbols on it. Somewhere in
the model world you might find the color red associated with a bird,
which would be a clue that the red dial should be turned to the bird
symbol. (<a href="https://aareed.itch.io/blue-lacuna">Blue Lacuna by Aaron Reed</a> has a puzzle of this type.)</p>

<p>Large mechanisms such as revolving rooms can operate as combination
locks: To use one or more of the exits from the room, you’ll need to
figure out how the buttons and levers change the orientation of the
room. In another variant, the buttons and levers might not be in the
same room as the lock mechanism itself: To solve the puzzle, you may
need to travel from room to room to see what happened when you moved the
lever.</p>

<p>In a more general sense, any puzzle that requires the player to
perform two or more actions in a specific order qualifies as a
combination lock. If the game includes a muzzle-loading rifle, for
instance, the player will need to pour the powder into the barrel, place
a patch on the end of the barrel, put the ball in the patch, and then
use the ramrod to push the ball and patch down into the barrel. If the
player puts the bullet into the barrel first and then the powder, the
rifle won’t fire. (The real procedure also requires measuring the
powder, tapping the stock against the ground to settle the powder, and
using a bullet starter before the ramrod to get the ball started down
the barrel. But that may be too much detail for a game.)</p>

<h3 id="manipulation-difficulties">Manipulation Difficulties</h3>

<p>Many games include objects that are too heavy to lift, too hot, too
slippery, or difficult to handle for some other reason. This type of
puzzle offers many opportunities for the author. Providing a handy oven
mitt for picking up the hot object might be too obvious: you might want
to give the player a baseball glove instead.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to operate
machinery can be easy, or almost endlessly complicated. In <a href="https://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/info/Craft.Of.Adventure.pdf">The Craft of
Adventure (PDF)</a>, Graham Nelson comments, “In some ways the easiest puzzles to
write sensibly are machines, which need to be manipulated: levers to
pull, switches to press, cogs to turn, ropes to pull&hellip;. They often
require tools, which brings in objects. They can transform things in a
semi-magical way (coal to diamonds being the cliché) and can plausibly
do almost anything if sufficiently mysterious and strange: time travel,
for instance.”</p>

<p>Among the things one may find in a game that pose manipulation
difficulties &ndash; and also implementation difficulties for the author &ndash; are
fire, water, rope, and chemicals of all kinds. <a href="../RB_10.html">Chapter 10 of the
<em>Inform Recipe Book</em></a> has some good examples of how to create
puzzles of this type. You might want the player to mix three chemicals
to create a new substance, for instance. Mixing would naturally require
a container that the ingredients can be put into. (The cocoa mug puzzle
in “Lydia’s Heart” was easily the most complex and difficult puzzle to
write in the game, and I’m still not sure it’s free of bugs. The puzzle
had three ingredients &ndash; a paper envelope full of powdered cocoa, a
sleeping pill, and some water. The water could be either hot or cold,
and once the pill or powder was combined with the water, it couldn’t be
extracted again. This kind of thing can be fun if it’s well done, but
it’s treacherously easy to do it badly.)</p>

<p>Here’s a simpler example of <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.arts.int-fiction/c/5vue1RyLZEk/m/vPTSk7_0AvUJ">a manipulation difficulty puzzle, which
was suggested by a post from Susie on the newsgroup</a>. The player can only
see things while wearing glasses. To implement this, we need to
intercept both the LOOK and EXAMINE actions. It also seems advisable to
stop the player from picking things up while not wearing the glasses.
But if we do that, we also have to be careful to allow her to pick up
the glasses while not wearing them &ndash; otherwise, dropping the glasses
will make the game unwinnable.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player is wearing some glasses. The description is &quot;They&apos;re as thick as bottle-bottoms.&quot; Understand &quot;bifocals&quot; and &quot;spectacles&quot; as the glasses.\n\nInstead of looking when the player is not wearing the glasses:\n\tsay &quot;Unfortunately, you&apos;re as blind as a bat without your glasses.&quot;\t\nInstead of examining something when the player is not wearing the glasses:\n\ttry looking instead.\n\nInstead of taking something when the player is not wearing the glasses:\n\tsay &quot;You grope around, but you can&apos;t find a darn thing.&quot;\n\nInstead of taking the glasses when the player is not wearing the glasses:\n\tif the player does not enclose the glasses:\n\t\tsay &quot;You grope around blindly and somehow find your glasses.&quot;;\n\t\tnow the player carries the glasses;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;ve already got them.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player is wearing some glasses.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking something when the player is not wearing the glasses:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You grope around, but you can't find a darn thing."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the glasses when the player is not wearing the glasses:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You've already got them."</div>
</div>

<p>Because the instead rule about taking the glasses is more specific
than the instead rule about taking something, it will be listed earlier
in the instead rulebook. This is what we want: The player will be able
to pick up the glasses.</p>

<p>A subtype of manipulation difficulties is what we might call the
strapped-to-a-table puzzle. I’ve seen this puzzle presented at the
beginning of a game, but it might happen at any point, especially after
the player character has been knocked unconscious. The puzzle is, you
don’t seem to be able to do <em>anything.</em> The repertoire of actions
normally allowed in IF is all (or seemingly all) disabled. In Emily
Short’s one-room game “Glass,” for instance, you’re a bird on a perch.
Your wings have been clipped, so you can’t even fly. Eventually the
player discovers that there’s one thing that the bird <em>can</em> do.
But I’ll let you discover for yourself what it is.</p>

<h3 id="enigmas">Enigmas</h3>

<p>A commentator on rec.arts.int-fiction (I’ve forgotten who) made an
interesting distinction between puzzles and problems. Problems, he
maintained, are difficulties that are intrinsic or sensible in the world
of the story. By that definition, most of what we’ve been looking at in
this chapter are problems, not puzzles. A puzzle-type puzzle, in
contrast, is something that doesn’t have any business being in the world
of the story: It’s there strictly to give the player some mental
gymnastics. If we’re going to keep using the word “puzzle” in a broader
sense, to refer to all of the problems that the PC may face during the
story, we might call this type of puzzle an enigma.</p>

<p>The ultimate example of an enigma is the game <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=w5s3sv43s3p98v45">Gostak by Carl
Muckenhaupt</a>. In this game, <em>all</em> of the nouns and verbs,
including the ones you use in commands, have been replaced by nonsense
words of the author’s own devising. The puzzle is to figure out how to
read the text of the game and issue commands. <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=7d5kjxqadyuyfgzu">Roger Firth’s “Letters
from Home”</a> is also an enigma-based game, with only a thin veneer of
story.</p>

<h3 id="deceptive-appearances-unusual-usages">Deceptive Appearances &amp; Unusual Usages</h3>

<p>An object with a deceptive appearance is different from an object
whose description is poorly written (see “Inadequate Implementation,”
below). The initial description of an object might be vague because the
PC has never seen anything like it and doesn’t know what it is, or
because only part of it is present, thus giving it an enigmatic shape,
or because it is in an odd condition.</p>

<p>As a simple example, consider an object called “a wadded-up piece of
paper”. This is quite likely a deceptive appearance. If you try READ
PAPER, you’ll probably be told, “You can’t read a wadded-up piece of
paper!” However, commands like SMOOTH PAPER and UNFOLD PAPER will
probably change the name of the item to “a slightly wrinkled note”,
after which READ PAPER or READ NOTE will reveal what’s written on
it.</p>

<p>A variant of the unusual usage puzzle is what we might call the
unexpected action puzzle. This isn’t quite the same as a guess-the-verb
puzzle, because the author has done it on purpose. Suppose, for
instance, that you’ve got a little glass bottle with some tablets in it.
The top of the bottle is stuck tight, so OPEN BOTTLE simply doesn’t
work. However, BREAK BOTTLE might be the intended solution of the
puzzle. This particular example also fits in the locked container
category. A better example might be an object described as “a small
tarnished piece of metal.” The command POLISH METAL might turn this
object into a mirror which which you could direct a beam of light. To
implement this, you’d also want to change the object’s printed name
property. A better solution, especially if the mirror is going to be
useful as a solution to a later puzzle, is to whisk the tarnished piece
of metal off-stage and replace it with a new object that has been
waiting in the wings. The rubbing action already has “polish” as a
synonym, so we can write this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a small tarnished piece of metal. The description is &quot;It&apos;s rather corroded.&quot;\n\nThe polished hand mirror is a thing. The description is &quot;A gleaming smooth mirror, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.&quot;\n\nInstead of rubbing the piece of metal:\n\tnow the piece of metal is nowhere;\n\tnow the player carries the polished hand mirror;\n\tsay &quot;As you rub the corrosion from the piece of metal, its true identity is revealed: It&apos;s a hand mirror!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a small tarnished piece of metal. The description is "It's rather corroded."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The polished hand mirror is a thing. The description is "A gleaming smooth mirror, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand."</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the piece of metal is nowhere;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the polished hand mirror;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "As you rub the corrosion from the piece of metal, its true identity is revealed: It's a hand mirror!"</div>
</div>
<h3 id="assembly-required">Assembly Required</h3>

<p>Sometimes objects have been
taken apart, and the player has to put them back together in order to
use them. In Chapter 3 of this <em>Handbook</em> we looked at a postcard
and a stamp. The stamp could be attached to the postcard. If this is a
puzzle, maybe the player would then have to put the postcard into a slot
in the Post Office. If the stamp hasn’t been attached, the message will
never be delivered.</p>

<p>Another simple example would be a length of metal pipe that can be
inserted into an appropriately positioned hole in a machine. When the
player does this, the piece of metal becomes a crank that can be
turned.</p>

<p>The relationships among the parts may be obvious &ndash; a lightbulb that
needs to be put in a lamp, for instance. Or the player may be called on
to improvise by assembling objects that have no obvious relationship to
one another.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=9ntef9expou18abv">The King of Shreds &amp; Patches</a> has a very nice assembly puzzle in
the form of a flintlock pistol that has to be loaded before it can be
fired. The materials (powder, lead balls, and so on) are all readily at
hand, but the player has to figure out how to manipulate them. What’s
especially nice about this puzzle is that once the player has done it
the first time the hard way, the command LOAD PISTOL can be used as a
shortcut to do it again.</p>

<h3 id="mechanisms">Mechanisms</h3>

<p>Mechanical devices that have to be switched on, or that need power to
operate, are common. A mechanical device may have several buttons or
levers, and it may not be obvious what the buttons and levers do. They
might seem to do nothing, or do nothing in the room that the player is
in while having an important effect in a different room. Or the result
of pressing a button or pulling a lever might be delayed for a few
turns.</p>

<p>A mechanical device may have a gauge or data readout whose meaning is
not clear. If you pull the red lever, for instance, the green dial might
change to read “3”. In this case, you may have to figure out what
several levers do, and what the readings on the dials mean.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>

<p>A vehicle in which the player
can travel around will seldom be a puzzle in its own right. More often,
it’s an example of one or two other types of puzzles ― mapping and
manipulation difficulties. That is, you’ll need to figure out how to use
the vehicle, which may involve finding the lost steering wheel or just
understanding what the red and green buttons do; and then learn,
probably by pressing the red button, where it can take you. On occasion
you may have to fuel the vehicle, which would come under the heading
“Assembly Required.” You may find that some objects can’t be carried in
the vehicle, which would be an inventory-blocked passageway, or that the
vehicle is required in order to carry certain objects from place to
place &ndash; again, an inventory-blocked passageway. You may need to get out
of the moving vehicle at a specific moment, which would be a timed
puzzle.</p>

<p>Conveyances such as wheelbarrows, that have to be pushed from place
to place, are used, again, mainly as a way of handling inventory
objects.</p>

<h3 id="consulting-information-sources">Consulting Information Sources</h3>

<p>In many games, key pieces of information are hidden in a large book,
or possibly in a computer terminal of some sort. To get at the
information, the player uses a syntax like LOOK UP KING HENRY IN HISTORY
BOOK or LOOK UP POISONS IN COMPUTER. The solution to this sort of puzzle
is to keep trying topics until you find an input that the information
source responds to. Or the player may need to find another piece of
information somewhere that says, in essence, “King Henry is listed on
page 447 of the history book.” Once the player is in possession of this
information, TURN TO PAGE 447 should reveal the information.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the information may simply be written on a piece of
paper in the game, or scrawled on a blackboard, and the puzzle is to
find it. In some games, the information on the paper or blackboard is
incomplete or difficult to understand. It may be written in code, or the
paper on which it’s written may have been torn up, forcing the player to
collect the scraps in order to decipher the complete message.</p>

<p>Not all of the information sources in games are in the form of
encyclopedias, computers, and carelessly dropped notes. If you see any
murals, mosaics, paintings, or tapestries in a game, pay close attention
to the images depicted on them. Likewise carvings. Sound and video
playback devices are a bit less often used, but they do show up from
time to time. The player may need to TURN ON TAPE PLAYER, for instance,
followed by an esoteric command like FAST-FORWARD TO 447.</p>

<p>With an informal type of information source, it’s usual that you
won’t know immediately whether you’re getting useful information or just
background on the story. This is especially true of NPCs, who may ramble
on about all sorts of topics, their conversation containing disguised or
ambiguous information.</p>

<h3 id="the-uncooperative-character">The Uncooperative Character</h3>

<p>People and animals can function as puzzles in several different ways.
Guards and guard dogs, for instance, can be relied on not to let the
player pass through a tempting doorway. The door isn’t locked, but it
might as well be. The player has to figure out a way to distract or make
friends with the guard. Almost any character can act as a guard &ndash; a
fussy librarian, for instance, who won’t let the player into the
computer room until the player shows her a library card.</p>

<p>Instead, a character might have an object that the player needs, and
the puzzle might be how to get him or her to hand it over. Some
characters can do things the player character can’t, in which case the
puzzle is how to get the character to follow instructions and perform
some action. The player might be unable to retrieve an object at the
bottom of a pool, for instance, not knowing how to swim &ndash; but a friendly
dolphin might be willing to obey orders. (How a dolphin would pick
something up … I’ll leave you to work that out for yourself.)</p>

<h3 id="timed-puzzles">Timed Puzzles</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, time passes in IF only when you issue a command.
(A few games include real-time events, but this is not common.) In a
timed puzzle, something is happening, and you need to interact with it
within a specified number of turns. You may need to figure out the
proper command, or even issue a whole sequence of commands, within a
fixed time-frame.</p>

<p>The simplest type of timed puzzle is, of course, a lighted fuse
attached to a bomb. Also simple (and dating back to the very first IF)
is the light source that will expire after a fixed number of turns,
perhaps because it’s a battery-powered flashlight. The player who is
left in a dark room when the battery dies is likely to be in serious
trouble. In the early days of IF, games sometimes required that the PC
eat and/or sleep on a regular schedule; failure to do so would have bad
consequences. Eating and sleeping are no longer common in modern games,
because they’re not very interesting.</p>

<p>The rowboat puzzle in “King of
Shreds &amp; Patches” is a complex timed puzzle. You’re in a boat on a
river, and the boat is being carried downstream by the current. Unless
you visualize clearly how the boat is moving and issue the correct
navigation commands, you’ll be unable to reach the dock before the small
hole in the bottom of the boat causes the boat to sink.</p>

<p>If you fail to take the proper action in a timed puzzle, the game
will almost certainly become unwinnable, and quite likely will end in a
sudden and spectacular way. Timed puzzles are, by their nature, somewhat
more cruel than other types of puzzles, because the possibility of
losing the game is more immediate.</p>

<p>A relative of the timed puzzle is what might be called a
course-of-events game. In a game of this sort, you may be able to get
from the start of the story to the end by typing ‘z’ over and over &ndash; no
action is required, as the course of events will unfold without your
taking any action at all. However, if you do that, you may well miss the
point of the story entirely, or fail to reach the most desirable ending.
Your opportunity to influence the course of events (and thereby steer
the course of the story) will have passed unnoticed. The puzzle lies in
figuring out exactly how your actions may influence the course of
events. Asking certain questions of a character at certain times, for
instance, may have a large effect &ndash; but it may not be obvious what to
ask, or when. Emily Short’s short game “Glass” provides an excellent
example of this type of puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="inadequate-implementation">Inadequate Implementation</h3>

<p>This isn’t really a type of puzzle, except in the technical sense:
It’s a design flaw ― and a serious one. In an inadequate implementation
puzzle (which can be of almost any type), the player lacks necessary
information because the author has neglected to include it, either in
the output text or in the software code. The “puzzle” boils down to
making random guesses or reading the author’s mind, which is pretty much
the same thing.</p>

<p>The most common subtype of the inadequate implementation puzzle is
called a guess-the-verb puzzle. You (the player) can see exactly what
you need to do to solve the puzzle, but the author has failed to write
code that handles any of the obvious and appropriate commands that you
try. Very few things are more infuriating for an IF player than trying
‘stab guard with sword’, ‘cut guard with sword’, ‘kill guard’, ‘attack
guard with sword’, and so on, being met in each case with a blank
refusal by the game, only to find that the correct syntax is ‘swing
sword’ while you’re in the room with the guard.</p>

<p>Another subtype is the inadequately described room or object.
Describing the manner in which a complex mechanical puzzle is
constructed is not easy, and it’s a place where many authors fall down
on the job.</p>

<p>In his excellent essay <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/info/Craft.Of.Adventure.txt">The Craft of Adventure</a>, Graham Nelson points
out a related pitfall ― the in-joke puzzle. You may know what
scatological phrase is suggested by using the Greek letters in the name
of a certain fraternity as an acronym, or that Petrarch wrote sonnets
about a woman named Laura, or the month for which the birthstone is
topaz (it’s November), but it’s unlikely your players will make the
connection.</p>

<p>In writing your game, it’s vital that you think carefully about the
design of your puzzles.</p>

<p>First, have you given the player enough information to enable her to
solve the puzzle? Remember: Something that’s obvious to you (the author)
may be mystifying to anyone who can’t read your mind.</p>

<p>Second, have you considered and built into your game all of the
commands you can think of that a player might use while working on a
puzzle? Almost as bad as guess-the-verb puzzles are misleading responses
from the parser. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>hit guard</div>

<p>Violence isn’t the answer to this one.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>hit guard with stick</div>

<p>You smack the guard in the head with the stick, and he goes down like
a sack of potatoes. Congratulations! Now you can steal the jewels from
the vault!</p>
</div>

<p>Inform’s default response to HIT GUARD is just plain wrong in this
case, because violence <em>is</em> the answer to this one.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7-winning-losing">Chapter 7: Winning &amp; Losing</h2>

<p>Inform has no built-in concept of “winning” or “losing” &ndash; it’s up to
you to define how your game will end. To end the game, put the phrase
“end the story” in a rule somewhere &ndash; perhaps like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Forest is a room. &quot;Tall trees stand on all sides.&quot;\n\nThe gold crown is in the Forest. The description is &quot;The crown is studded with sparkling jewels!&quot;\n\nAfter taking the crown:\n\tend the story saying “You have won!”\n\nThe player carries a cyanide pill. The cyanide pill is edible.\n\nAfter eating the cyanide pill:\n\tend the story saying “Alas, you have died.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Forest is a room. "Tall trees stand on all sides."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The gold crown is in the Forest. The description is "The crown is studded with sparkling jewels!"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking the crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “You have won!”</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries a cyanide pill. The cyanide pill is edible.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After eating the cyanide pill:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “Alas, you have died.”</div>
</div>

<p>An After rule is a good place to end the game, because it gives
Inform a chance to make sure the action actually took place before
ending the game.</p>

<p>If you don’t add your own text to the “end the story” command, Inform
will simply print out “*** The End ***. It’s usually a good idea to
write a line immediately before the “end the story” line, in order to
describe what the player has done to end the game before officially
ending it. We might revise our code like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After taking the crown:\n\tsay &quot;At last! You&apos;ve found the gold crown you&apos;ve been seeking!&quot;;\n\tend the story saying “You have won!”\n\nAfter eating the cyanide pill:\n\tsay &quot;Moments after ingesting the pill, you begin to feel very, very ill.&quot;;\n\tend the story saying “Alas, you have died.”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After taking the crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "At last! You've found the gold crown you've been seeking!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “You have won!”</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After eating the cyanide pill:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Moments after ingesting the pill, you begin to feel very, very ill.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “Alas, you have died.”</div>
</div>

<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but sometimes the end of a game calls
for something less drastic than the death of the player character.
Depending on the story, maybe the game should detect that the player is
giving up too soon. In that case, you could do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After taking the crown:\n\tsay &quot;At last! You&apos;ve found the gold crown you&apos;ve been seeking!&quot;;\n\tend the story saying “You have won!”\n\nAfter eating the cyanide pill:\n\tsay &quot;Moments after ingesting the pill, you begin to feel very, very ill.&quot;;\n\tend the story saying “Alas, you have died.”\n\nThis is fine as far as it goes, but sometimes the end of a game calls for something less drastic than the death of the player character.

In that case, you could do this:\n\nInstead of going north in the Forest:\n\tsay &quot;As you wander back down the mountainside toward town, you feel a keen and lingering sense of regret.&quot;;\n\tend the story saying &quot;You have missed the point entirely!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After taking the crown:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "At last! You've found the gold crown you've been seeking!";</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>

</div>

<p>After the phrase “end the story saying”, you can give whatever
message you like. This will appear, surrounded by the rows of asterisks,
when the game ends.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, “end the story” is a phrase that <em>must</em> include
the word “the”. More often than not, Inform strips out “the” when
compiling, but here it’s required.</p>

<p>In <a href="../WI_9.html#section_4">WI 9.4 When
play ends</a>, a distinction is made between “end the story” and “end the
story finally.” I haven’t been able to figure out exactly what the
difference is. I suggest just using “end the story” without worrying
about “finally.”</p>

<h3 id="a-word-about-fairness">A Word About Fairness</h3>

<p>In the early days of interactive fiction, numerous games were
released that would kill the player without warning. That was part of
the fun (?) &ndash; when you opened a door, maybe an ogre would jump out at
you and hit you with his club, and the game was over. If you had been
smart enough to save your game position not too long before, you could
restore the saved game and try to be more careful about the ogre the
second time. If you hadn’t been smart, you might have to spend hours
getting back to that game position again.</p>

<p>Today, many players and authors feel that this type of story event is
more annoying than fun. The trend is to give the player some sort of
advance warning, which might be subtle or obvious, when the player
character is about to get in a dangerous spot. “Dark red stains have
seeped into the floorboards around the door” in the room description
would be a good way to warn the player that opening the door could be
dangerous, and that looking around for a way to do it cautiously would
be a good idea.</p>

<p>It’s all too easy to write a game, even without meaning to, in such a
way that the player can make the game unwinnable. For instance, the
player may need to give the chocolate biscuit to the elf so that the elf
will be willing to part with the silver key … but the biscuit might be
edible, and the player might have eaten it a hundred moves before
meeting the elf. Another example: Maybe the player can’t return to a
region of the map after leaving it. A rope bridge might have fallen the
first time the player crossed it, leaving no way to get back across the
canyon. If the player dropped the gold key on the far side of the
bridge, she won’t be able to go back and get it. If the gold key is
required to open something that’s on <em>this</em> side of the canyon,
the game has become unwinnable.</p>

<p>You need to think carefully about where in your story this type of
problem can arise, and decide how you want to handle it. Drawing a
diagram of the flow of the story &ndash; of the puzzle structure, in other
words &ndash; may be helpful.</p>

<p>One way to handle the situation is to simply not allow the player to
do anything that would make the game unwinnable. If the chocolate
biscuit will be needed later, write something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of eating the chocolate biscuit, say &quot;It&apos;s a mouth-watering treat, no doubt, but you decide to save it for later.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of eating the chocolate biscuit, say "It's a mouth-watering treat, no doubt, but you decide to save it for later."</div>
</div>

<p>It can be a chore to come up with sensible-sounding reasons why the
player character wouldn’t do something, if it seems a perfectly natural
thing to want to do. After all, the player can’t read your mind, and
doesn’t know what actions or objects will later be needed to win the
game. For variety, I sometimes allow the player to do something that
will turn out to make the game unwinnable, but then add an immediate
message giving a broad hint (which the player is free to ignore) that
that was probably a stupid thing to do:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After eating the chocolate biscuit:\n\tsay &quot;You chow down on the delicious biscuit and lick the last of the chocolate from your fingers. Afterward, though, you start to worry. Maybe you shouldn’t have indulged your gluttonous impulses quite so casually.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After eating the chocolate biscuit:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You chow down on the delicious biscuit and lick the last of the chocolate from your fingers. Afterward, though, you start to worry. Maybe you shouldn’t have indulged your gluttonous impulses quite so casually.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>The player who reads this will probably be smart enough to UNDO the
latest action, thereby retrieving the chocolate biscuit.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-score">Keeping Score</h3>

<p>In a game whose story is serious in tone, awarding points might seem
too frivolous, so you might want to use no scoring. Inform allows the
author, however, to give the player points for doing certain actions. A
way to do this is explained in <a href="../WI_9.html#section_2">WI 9.2 Awarding points</a>. The first step is to put this line
near the top of your source code, along with whatever other Use or
Include options you’ve selected:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use scoring.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use scoring.</div>
</div>

<p>Among its other effects, this line will cause the current score to be
displayed alongside the turn count in the banner at the top of the game
window. Normally, you would award points in an After rule, like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After taking the gold crown for the first time:\n\tincrease the score by 10;\n\tsay &quot;Ah, you&apos;ve finally gotten your hands on it!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After taking the gold crown for the first time:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by 10;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Ah, you've finally gotten your hands on it!"</div>
</div>

<p>Unless we include “continue the action” at the end of the After rule,
the After rule will halt the action processing <em>before</em> the
Report rule has a chance to tell the player that taking the gold crown
has succeeded. So if you’re not going to print out a message of your own
when awarding points, you’ll want to add the line “continue the action”
after awarding the points. This will cause the Report rule to report
“Taken”, “You put the bulb in the socket”, or whatever.</p>

<p>When awarding points, you should get in the habit of always including
the phrase “for the first time” in the rule that awards the points. If
you forget to do this, the player will be able to rack up a huge score
by performing the same action over and over!</p>

<p>Having explained that, however, I’m now going to suggest that you not
do it that way. The reason is because the phrase “for the first time”
applies only the first time the player <em>attempts</em> to do
something, whether or not it succeeds. So if the gold crown is in a
locked transparent display case and the player tries TAKE CROWN while
the case is still locked, no points will be awarded, but later, when the
case is unlocked, taking the crown still won’t award any points, because
now it’s not the first time the action has been attempted.</p>

<p>It’s much safer to use one of Inform’s built-in properties,
<strong>handled,</strong> to check whether points should be awarded:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After taking the gold crown when the gold crown is not handled:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After taking the gold crown when the gold crown is not handled:</div>
</div>

<p>Use “for the first time” to award points <em>only</em> when you can
be sure that the action will succeed the first time the player attempts
it.</p>

<p><a href="../examples/mutts_adventure.html">Example 136: Mutt's Adventure</a> and <a href="../examples/no_place_like_home.html">Example 137: No Place Like Home</a> show other ways of awarding points. <a href="../WI_9.html#section_3">WI 9.3: Introducing tables: rankings</a> shows how to
create a table of rankings that will tell the player how well he or she
is doing. This feature was popular in early IF games, and some authors
still enjoy using it.</p>

<p>Inform doesn’t insist that the number of points awarded for an action
be constant. If you like, you can do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`crown-points is a number that varies. crown-points is 10.\n\nAfter taking the gold crown when the gold crown is not handled:\n\tincrease the score by crown-points;\n\tsay &quot;Ah, you&apos;ve finally got your hands on it!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">crown-points is a number that varies. crown-points is 10.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking the gold crown when the gold crown is not handled:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by crown-points;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Ah, you've finally got your hands on it!"</div>
</div>

<p>If you’ve set it up this way, you can vary the number of points the
player will gain for taking the crown depending on what else has
happened in the game. You can even award a negative number of points,
thus reducing the player’s overall score. In my first game, “Not Just an
Ordinary Ballerina” (which was written in Inform 6, not Inform 7), I set
up a system that would reduce the number of points the player could gain
by solving each puzzle based on the number of hints the player had
consulted about that puzzle. The only way to get the maximum score for
winning the game was never to consult the hints. This was meant to give
players an incentive to use their ingenuity rather than relying on the
hints.</p>

<p>If your game has scoring, it’s a good idea to keep a list somewhere
of how many points are being awarded for each scored action. Add up the
total possible score. Near the top of your source code, tell Inform the
maximum score, as suggested on <a href="../WI_9.html#section2">WI 9.2: Awarding
Points</a>:

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The maximum score is 12.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The maximum score is 12.</div>
</div>

<h4 id="a-treasure-chest">A Treasure Chest</h4>

<p>Awarding points when an object is picked up or a room entered is the
usual thing to do in a game. But some classic games require that the
player put the objects that have been found in a treasure chest or
trophy case. Awarding points for this action is slightly tricky, because
the treasure chest might be a closed openable container. If it happens
to be closed the first time the player tries to put a given treasure
into it, the points will never be awarded. Consider this code:</p>

<p>The Lab is a room.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After inserting the fish into the trunk:\n\tif the fish is in the trunk for the first time:\n\t\tincrease the score by 1;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After inserting the fish into the trunk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fish is in the trunk for the first time:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>That certainly looks as if it should work. But here’s the output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>put fish in trunk</div>

<p>The old shipping trunk is closed.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>open trunk</div>

<p>You open the old shipping trunk.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>put fish in trunk</div>

<p>You put the fish into the old shipping trunk.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>score</div>

<p>You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 4 turns.</p>
</div>
<p>No points were awarded for putting the fish in the trunk, because the
first time the player tried it, the trunk was closed. Here’s the correct
way to write the After rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After inserting the fish into the trunk:\n\tif the fish is in the trunk for the first time:\n\t\tincrease the score by 1;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After inserting the fish into the trunk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fish is in the trunk for the first time:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>But wait &hellip; what if we want the player to be awarded points only
while the treasure <em>remains</em> in the treasure chest? This requires
a slightly different approach. What we need to do is award a point each
time the treasure is successfully inserted into the treasure chest, and
also subtract a point each time the treasure is taken out of the chest.
To subtract a point, just increase the score by -1. Here’s one way to do
that, using the example of the fish and the old trunk, as before:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After inserting the fish into the trunk:\n\tif the fish is in the trunk:\n\t\tincrease the score by 1;\n\tcontinue the action.\n\nInstead of taking the fish:\n\tif the fish is in the trunk:\n\t\tdecrease the score by 1;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After inserting the fish into the trunk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fish is in the trunk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the fish:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the fish is in the trunk:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;decrease the score by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>This use of an Instead rule assumes that there are no active Check
rules that would subsequently prevent the taking of the fish; Instead
runs before Check in the action processing. In most cases it should work
for you.</p>

<h3 id="achievements">Achievements</h3>

<p>Some authors feel that keeping a numerical score trivializes a
serious game, or isn’t interesting from a literary standpoint. Even so,
it would be nice to let the player know what kind of progress he or she
is making. Instead of producing a numerical score in response to the
SCORE command, we can give the player a list of achievements. To do
this, we’ll use a table. Tables are one of Inform’s more advanced
features, and the syntax for using them is not entirely intuitive. At
the end of this example, so as to give you a better grasp of tables,
we’ll take a look at how the code works.</p>

<p>We’re going to create a game with three achievements &ndash; picking up a
ruby, taking off some goggles (which are being worn), and putting a
guppy back in the fish tank. These are listed in the Table of
Achievements. The table has three columns: object, achievement, and
flag. In the object column, we’ll enter the name of the object that is
being handled when the achievement happens. In the achievement column is
some text describing the achievement. The flag column contains a number;
this starts out as 0, but we’ll change it to 1 when the player

</div>

<p>The heavy lifting in this example is done by the new announce the
score rule, which replaces the announce the score rule (one of the
Standard Rules). The new rule does two things. First, it uses a loop
(“repeat with N running from 1&hellip;”) to count the number of achievements
the player has so far done. Each time it finds a row where the flag is
1, it increases the flag-count. Then it prints out a message. If the
flag-count is still zero, nothing has been accomplished, so the rule
will say so and stop.</p>

<p>If the flag-count is at least 1, that means the player has done
something. In this case we start the printout by saying, “So far you
have [run paragraph on]”. Then we go through the Table of Achievements
again, looking for and listing achievements. As we go, we decrease the
flag-count &ndash; but we’ve taken the precaution of storing it in
total-flag-count before the process starts. This is so we’ll know
whether the list is exactly two items long, or whether it’s longer. If
it’s exactly two items long, we want to print “ and ” between them, but
if it’s three or more items long, we want to print “, and ” between the
last two. This is the serial comma. If you’re not using the <a href="#Ref_serial_comma">serial comma</a>
in your game, you can omit
the lines that use total-flag-count.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-8-time-scenes">Chapter 8: Time &amp; Scenes</h2>

<p>Lots of interactive fiction
games take place in a sort of “eternal now.” The player is free to
wander around, trying whatever commands she thinks of. No matter how
many turns she takes, nothing changes in the model world except when she
takes an action that changes it.</p>

<p>In other games, though, the passage of time has some effect on the
game-play. That is, the game counts the number of turns the player
spends doing things, and makes some change after a set number of turns.
For instance, the sun might set, in which case outdoor rooms would
become dark. In almost all games, nothing whatever happens between the
player’s commands: time passes only when the player does something. A
very few games include some sort of “real time” routine to force the
player to type the correct command within a few seconds, but these games
are quite rare, and we’re not going to worry about them in this
book.</p>

<p>Inform has three systems with which you can organize the passage of
time of your game. In this chapter we’ll look at all of them.</p>

<h3 id="passing-time">Passing Time</h3>

<p>Inform doesn’t do anything to mark the passage of time in a game
unless you tell it to. All the same, it’s quietly keeping track of the
number of turns that have passed since the beginning of the game. Unless
you write some code that changes the default, Inform starts the game at
9:00 A.M. Each time the player enters a sensible command, one minute
passes. But if the player types something that the parser doesn’t
understand, no time passes.</p>

<p>A simple way to see this mechanism in action is to add this code to
your game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`When play begins:\n\tnow the right hand status line is &quot;[time of day]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".</div>
</div>

<p>The status line<span id="Ref_status_line" class="anchor"></span> is
the bar across the top of the game window. Normally (unless you do
something to change it), the right side of the status line is empty, but
this code can be used to show the number of points the player has earned
(“[score]”), for example. The code above changes the status line to show
the time of day. For more, see <a href="WI_8.html#section3">WI 8.3: Changing the status line</a>.

<p>As a courtesy to the player, you might want to have no time pass when
the player is simply using the LOOK command to refresh her memory about
the room, or the INV (or I) command to remind herself what she’s
carrying. To do that, use this code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn:\n\tif the current action is taking inventory or the current action is looking:\n\t\tnow the time of day is 1 minute before the time of day.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the current action is taking inventory or the current action is looking:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the time of day is 1 minute before the time of day.</div>
</div>

<p>We’ll have more to say about Every Turn rules later in this chapter.
Another way to do the same thing is to use a Before rule rather than an
Every Turn rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before looking or taking inventory:\n\tnow the time of day is 1 minute before the time of day.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before looking or taking inventory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the time of day is 1 minute before the time of day.</div>
</div>

<p>The downside of using a
Before rule in this case is that the first action when a game starts is
a look action. That’s what causes the initial room description to print.
So if you use a Before rule in this case, the game will be starting one
minute before you think it does, which could be a problem in a game that
opens with a tight timing puzzle.</p>

<p><a href="../examples/timeless.html">Example 408: Timeless</a>, shows a different way to accomplish the same
thing.</p>

<p>The game doesn’t have to start at 9:00 A.M. If you want it to start
at 3:00 in the afternoon, do this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`When play begins:\n\tnow the time of day is 3:00 pm.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the time of day is 3:00 pm.</div>
</div>

<p>If you want time to jump ahead for some reason (such as when the
player character has been hit on the head and is unconscious for a
while), include a line like this in your code as part of what happens
when the player is hit:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the time of day is 7:00 pm.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the time of day is 7:00 pm.</div>
</div>

<p>If you want something to happen at a specific time, one way to do it
&ndash; the primitive, clumsy way, as I’ll explain in a moment &ndash; is with an
Every Turn rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn:\n\tif the time of day is 11:59 pm or the time of day is 12:59 am or the time of day is 1:59 am:\n\t\tsay &quot;In the distance you hear the chimes in the tower strike the hour.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the time of day is 11:59 pm or the time of day is 12:59 am or the time of day is 1:59 am:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "In the distance you hear the chimes in the tower strike the hour."</div>
</div>

<p>As you can see, I’ve set the chimes to ring one minute
<em>before</em> the hour. This is because of the way Inform runs your
Every Turn rules. Every Turn rules run before the Advance Time rule. If
you do it as shown above, the message about the chimes in the tower will
be printed out on the hour.</p>

<p>In this case, Inform has a simpler way to get the same effect. You
can write a rule that tells the game what to do at specific times:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`At 11:59 pm: say chimes.\nAt 12:59 am: say chimes.\nAt 1:59 am: say chimes.\n\nTo say chimes: say &quot;In the distance you hear the chimes in the tower strike the hour.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">At 11:59 pm: say chimes.</div>
<div class="codeline">At 12:59 am: say chimes.</div>
<div class="codeline">At 1:59 am: say chimes.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say chimes: say "In the distance you hear the chimes in the tower strike the hour."</div>
</div>

<p>This way of doing it is easier to write and debug, especially when
you want the chimes to ring every hour for 24 hours, rather than only at
three times, as shown.</p>

<p>The main reason to want to keep track of the current time (and let
the player know what time it is) is because time is passing in the model
world. In some games, the player character will get hungry and/or
thirsty on a regular schedule, so finding food and water will be one of
the puzzles. If the game includes a realistic alternation of day and
night, at a certain time in the evening the player might need to find a
place to sleep. Some people consider eating and sleeping puzzles
old-fashioned, but timed puzzles can be interesting if handled in a
creative way.</p>

<h3 id="future-events">Future Events</h3>

<p><a href="../WI_9.html#section11">WI 9.11: Future
events</a> shows how to cue up events that will happen at a certain time
in the future. For the next example, I’ll borrow some code from the
chapter of the <em>Handbook</em> on characters. When the player tries to
take the spider, not only the game prevent the action, but there will be
an after-effect &ndash; a sort of emotional echo of the intended action:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the spider:\n\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t bring yourself even to get near it.&quot;;\n\tthe spider thought returns in four minutes from now.\n\nAt the time when the spider thought returns:\n\tsay &quot;You&apos;re still thinking about that creepy spider...&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the spider:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You can't bring yourself even to get near it.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the spider thought returns in four minutes from now.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">At the time when the spider thought returns:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You're still thinking about that creepy spider&hellip;"</div>
</div>

<p>Here I’ve created a new phrase, “the spider thought returns,” and
told Inform what to do when that event happens. There are two ways to
cue this action: You can say “in four minutes from now” or “in four
turns from now” (substituting your own number of turns or minutes,
obviously). If you’re making adjustments in the time of day, as shown
earlier in this chapter in the section “Passing Time,” four minutes from
now will <em>not</em> necessarily be the same as four turns from now.
The handy thing about this code is that the spider thought time will be
reset if the player tries to take the spider several times in a row: The
thought return will happen only once. If the player then tries to take
the spider <em>after</em> the thought has returned the first time, the
thought can return a second time.</p>

<p>If you need to trigger a more complex series of events rather than
something that happens once, using Scenes (see below) will give you
better tools.</p>

<p>If you want something to <em>maybe</em> happen in the future,
depending on some factor, you can use Inform’s handy “do nothing”
phrase. The example below was suggested by one of my students, who
wanted to transform a magic wand into an old shoe &ndash; but only if the
player has been carrying the wand for three turns in a row.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Wizard&apos;s Workshop is a room. &quot;This odd-smelling little room is crowded with tables and shelves overflowing with magical implements.&quot;\n\nThe magic wand is in the Wizard&apos;s Workshop. &quot;A Wham-O(tm) magic wand lies on the floor.&quot; The description is &quot;It&apos;s a shiny black plastic wand on which the words &apos;Wham-O&apos; are written in flowing white script.&quot;\nUnderstand &quot;wham-o&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;plastic&quot; as the magic wand.\n\nThe old shoe is a thing.

<div class="codeline">The magic wand is in the Wizard's Workshop. "A Wham-O(tm) magic wand lies on the floor." The description is "It's a shiny black plastic wand on which the words 'Wham-O' are written in flowing white script."</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The old shoe is a thing. The description is "It looks like somebody left it lying in the gutter."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking the magic wand:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the wand transforms in three turns from now;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">At the time when the wand transforms:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the wand:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;remove the magic wand from play;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the player carries the old shoe;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The wand quivers and squirms in your hand! Suddenly it's not a wand, it's an old shoe!"</div>
</div>

<p>Here, we start Inform’s internal “alarm clock” ticking when the
player takes the magic wand, using an After rule. If the player isn’t
carrying the wand when the “alarm clock” goes off, nothing happens. And
if the player drops the wand and picks it up again, Inform will
automatically reset the clock. The wand will only transform if it’s
carried for three turns in a row. Obviously, this type of scheduling of
future events has many other uses. In the code above, the transformation
can occur only once, because the wand ends up off-stage as a result of
the transformation. If you’re planning to use teleportation (moving the
wand somewhere interesting) rather than transformation, you’ll need to
think closely about what happens if the player triggers the event again
later.</p>

<h3 id="scenes">Scenes</h3>

<p>One of the more powerful features of Inform is its ability to
organize the story into scenes. An entire chapter of <a href="../WI_10.html"><em>Writing with
Inform</em> (Chapter 10, “Scenes”)</a>, is devoted to scenes. If you haven’t
read this chapter yet, give it a look. Some games won’t need scenes at
all, but scenes can be very handy for giving your story some structure.
Almost any time you need to create a complex, well-coordinated set of
changes in the model world, defining a scene is a good tool for the
job.</p>

<p>To create a scene, you simply give it a name, and then tell Inform
when it starts &ndash; that is, what set of events or circumstances triggers
it. You can also, optionally, tell Inform when the scene ends. By
default, a scene will happen only once. If you want it to be able to
happen over and over, you need to create it as a <em>recurring</em>
scene.</p>

<p>Why might you want to use a scene? Here are some random ideas:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Saucer-menace is a scene. Saucer-menace begins when the flying saucer is in the Meadow. Saucer-menace ends when the bug-eyed monster is dead.\n\nGuard-evasion is a scene. Guard-evasion begins when the security guard is suspicious. Guard-evasion ends when the player is in the Bank Vault for the first time. \n\nDance mania is a scene. Dance mania begins when the player is in the Abandoned Warehouse for the first time. Dance mania ends when the police sergeant is in the Abandoned Warehouse.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Saucer-menace is a scene. Saucer-menace begins when the flying saucer is in the Meadow. Saucer-menace ends when the bug-eyed monster is dead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Guard-evasion is a scene. Guard-evasion begins when the security guard is suspicious. Guard-evasion ends when the player is in the Bank Vault for the first time. </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Dance mania is a scene. Dance mania begins when the player is in the Abandoned Warehouse for the first time. Dance mania ends when the police sergeant is in the Abandoned Warehouse.</div>
</div>

<p>When a certain scene starts, you might want to rearrange the objects
in the model world, shuffling some items offstage and others onstage.
While the scene is happening, you might want to restrict the player’s
travel, or print out certain atmospheric messages (as shown in
<a href="../WI_10.html#section4">WI 10.4: During
scenes</a>). While a scene is happening, the magical weapons the player is
carrying might have different effects than at other times. The
possibilities are unlimited.</p>

<p>You can’t start a scene simply by saying that it starts:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now guard-evasion is happening; [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now guard-evasion is happening; [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Nor can you end a scene by saying that it ends. The way to start or
end a scene is to tie it to a condition, as shown above:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Guard-evasion begins when the security guard is suspicious.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Guard-evasion begins when the security guard is suspicious.</div>
</div>

<p>The condition can be as simple as whether a truth state that varies
(a true-or-false variable) is true or false. You could do it this
way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Guard-evasion-flag is a truth state that varies. Guard-evasion-flag is false.\n\nGuard-evasion is a scene. Guard-evasion begins when guard-evasion-flag is true.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Guard-evasion-flag is a truth state that varies. Guard-evasion-flag is false.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Guard-evasion is a scene. Guard-evasion begins when guard-evasion-flag is true.</div>
</div>

<p>Having set it up this way, you can start the scene whenever or
wherever you like by writing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now guard-evasion-flag is true;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now guard-evasion-flag is true;</div>
</div>
<h4 id="chaining-scenes">Chaining Scenes</h4>

<p><a href="../WI_10.html#section5">WI 10.5: Linking
scenes together</a> gives this simple example of how to chain two
scenes:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Train Stop is a scene. Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Train Stop ends.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Train Stop is a scene. Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Train Stop ends.</div>
</div>
<p>From this code, we can’t tell what events will cause Train Stop to
begin or end, but we can see that Brief Encounter will begin immediately
when Train Stop ends.</p>

<p>Setting up a new scene so that it starts a certain number of turns
after a previous scene ends is a little trickier. First, we need to
create a truth state. Second, we need to write a simple function that
will switch the truth state to true. Third, we need to tell Inform to
run the function at some time in the future. Here’s an example that
shows how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Antechamber is a room. &quot;The princess&apos;s boudoir lies to the south.&quot;\n\nThe Princess&apos;s Boudoir is south of the Antechamber. &quot;This luxuriously appointed chamber is fit for a princess.&quot;\n\nThe princess is a woman in the Boudoir. &quot;...and as it happens, a princess is sitting here right now!&quot;\n\nThe player carries some crown jewels. The indefinite article of the crown jewels is &quot;the&quot;.\n\nPrincess Demanding is a recurring scene. Princess Demanding begins when the player is in the Boudoir and the player carries the crown jewels.\n\nPrincess Demanding ends when the player does not carry the crown jewels.\n\nInstead of going during Princess Demanding:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;You&apos;re not going anywhere until you surrender the jewels!&apos; the princess insists.&quot;\n\nWhen Princess Demanding begins:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;I notice you&apos;re carrying the crown jewels,&apos; the princess says. &apos;Give them to me at once!&apos;&quot;\n\nInstead of giving the jewels to the princess:\n\tnow the princess carries the jewels;\n\tsay &quot;You surrender the jewels. The princess smiles sweetly. &apos;Thank you,&apos; she says. &apos;You may go.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Antechamber is a room. "The princess's boudoir lies to the south."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Princess's Boudoir is south of the Antechamber. "This luxuriously appointed chamber is fit for a princess."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The princess is a woman in the Boudoir. "&hellip;and as it happens, a princess is sitting here right now!"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries some crown jewels. The indefinite article of the crown jewels is "the".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Demanding is a recurring scene. Princess Demanding begins when the player is in the Boudoir and the player carries the crown jewels.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Demanding ends when the player does not carry the crown jewels.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going during Princess Demanding:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'You're not going anywhere until you surrender the jewels!' the princess insists."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">When Princess Demanding begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'I notice you're carrying the crown jewels,' the princess says. 'Give them to me at once!'"</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of giving the jewels to the princess:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the princess carries the jewels;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You surrender the jewels. The princess smiles sweetly. 'Thank you,' she says. 'You may go.'"</div>
</div>

<p>Here we’ve created a scene called Princess Demanding. The point of
this scene is the “Instead of going” rule. This rule gets in the way if
the player tries to leave the boudoir with the jewels. Other than this,
the scene is transparent &ndash; that is, it has no effect on game-play. The
player can drop the jewels or give them to the princess. At that point,
the scene ends (because we’ve written a rule that defines this as ending
the scene).</p>

<p>The keyword “during” in this Instead rule lets us write code that
will make sweeping changes in many aspects of the game depending on
whether a certain scene is happening.</p>

<p>We’ve made Princess Demanding a recurring scene. This is necessary.
If you leave out the word “recurring,” the player can get away with the
jewels by dropping them in the boudoir and then picking them up again.
When they’re dropped, the scene ends &ndash; and if it’s not a recurring
scene, it will never start again.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this scene more closely. It looks sensible on the
surface, but in fact there are some problems. By analyzing the problems,
you can start to get a better picture of how to write trouble-free
code.</p>

<p>In a real game the player would quite likely be able to figure out a
way to abscond with the jewels, even after the princess has noticed
them. Can you spot the problem? If you’ve read the section in Chapter 3
on “Testing Where a Thing Is,” you may recall that the condition “if the
player carries the crown” is only true if the crown is in the PC’s hands
&ndash; that is, if it’s directly carried. The bug will show up if we give the
player a container for carrying things:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The sack is a container. The player carries the sack.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The sack is a container. The player carries the sack.</div>
</div>

<p>Now the player can walk into the boudoir, which will cause the
princess to notice the jewels, and then put the jewels in the sack and
walk straight out again. Oops! The fix for this bug is simple. We change
“carries” in the end-of-scene statement to “encloses”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Princess Demanding ends when the player does not enclose the crown jewels.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Princess Demanding ends when the player does not enclose the crown jewels.</div>
</div>

<p>If you make these changes, the player will be able to put the jewels
in the sack and then enter the boudoir, and the princess will let him
leave again. Presumably, she hasn’t noticed the jewels because they’re
in the sack. But once the jewels are not in the sack but in the PC’s
hands, she’ll see them. At that point, putting them back in the sack
won’t help. The princess will still demand that they be turned over.</p>

<p>But there’s still a problem. Try this series of commands:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Test me with &quot;s / put jewels in sack / drop sack / take sack / n&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Test me with "s / put jewels in sack / drop sack / take sack / n".</div>
</div>

<p>The princess will notice the jewels &hellip; but you can still get away
with them by putting them in the sack, dropping the sack, and picking it
up again, because the Princess Demanding scene won’t start again as long
as the jewels are in the sack. Ah, but we don’t want to change the
definition of the start of the scene so that it uses “encloses” rather
than “carries,” because that would cause the princess to notice the
jewels for the first time even if they’re in the sack. What a
tangle!</p>

<p>The solution is in two parts. First, we need to keep track of what
the princess knows. In addition, we’ll create a second scene, Princess
Still Demanding. This scene will do the work of stopping the player from
leaving &ndash; and it will have a more complicated beginning. Here’s the
revised part of the code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The princess is a woman in the Boudoir. &quot;...and as it happens, a princess is sitting here right now!&quot;\nThe princess can be jewel-knowing or jewel-ignorant. The princess is jewel-ignorant.\n\nWhen Princess Demanding begins:\n\tnow the princess is jewel-knowing.\n\nThe player carries some crown jewels. The indefinite article of the crown jewels is &quot;the&quot;.\n\nThe sack is a container. The player carries the sack.\n\nPrincess Demanding is a scene. Princess Demanding begins when the player is in the Boudoir and the player carries the crown jewels.\n\nPrincess Still Demanding is a recurring scene. Princess Still Demanding begins when the player is in the boudoir and the player encloses the crown jewels and the princess is jewel-knowing.\n\nPrincess Demanding ends when Princess Still Demanding begins.\n\nPrincess Still Demanding ends when the player does not enclose the crown jewels.\n\nInstead of going during Princess Still Demanding:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;You&apos;re not going anywhere until you surrender the jewels!&apos; the princess insists.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The princess is a woman in the Boudoir. "&hellip;and as it happens, a princess is sitting here right now!"</div>
<div class="codeline">The princess can be jewel-knowing or jewel-ignorant. The princess is jewel-ignorant.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">When Princess Demanding begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the princess is jewel-knowing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries some crown jewels. The indefinite article of the crown jewels is "the".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The sack is a container. The player carries the sack.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Demanding is a scene. Princess Demanding begins when the player is in the Boudoir and the player carries the crown jewels.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Still Demanding is a recurring scene. Princess Still Demanding begins when the player is in the boudoir and the player encloses the crown jewels and the princess is jewel-knowing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Demanding ends when Princess Still Demanding begins.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Princess Still Demanding ends when the player does not enclose the crown jewels.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going during Princess Still Demanding:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'You're not going anywhere until you surrender the jewels!' the princess insists."</div>
</div>

<p>The first thing we’ve done here is give the princess a new either-or
property. She can be jewel-knowing or jewel-ignorant. At the beginning
of the game she’s jewel-ignorant. But when Princess Demanding begins,
she becomes jewel-knowing. The moment she becomes jewel-knowing, the
game switches to a different scene, Princess Still Demanding.</p>

<p>If you add this code to the original version of the example, the
player will be able to go in and out of the boudoir freely carrying the
jewels in the sack. But once the princess spies the jewels, the player
will be prevented from leaving whether the jewels are directly carried
or are being carried in a container.</p>

<p>There’s still at least one more problem with this example game, which
illustrates just how tricky writing IF can be. If the player drops the
jewels on the floor, the princess will just leave them lying there.
She’ll let you leave, but if you leave the boudoir and come back, you’ll
find that the jewels are still lying on the floor in plain sight. A
writer of conventional fiction might describe this by saying that the
princess’s motivation (her reasons for her actions) is not consistent.
We can fix this with an Every Turn rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn:\n\tif the holder of the crown jewels is the Boudoir:\n\t\tnow the princess carries the crown jewels;\n\t\tsay &quot;The princess scoops up the jewels. &apos;These belong to my family,&apos; she says, adding haughtily, &apos;you may go.&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the holder of the crown jewels is the Boudoir:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the princess carries the crown jewels;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The princess scoops up the jewels. 'These belong to my family,' she says, adding haughtily, 'you may go.'"</div>
</div>

<p>As an exercise, I’ll leave you the chore of setting it up so that if
the princess is jewel-knowing, the jewels are in the sack, and the sack
is on the floor of the boudoir, the princess will take the jewels from
the sack. The moral of the story is this: When planning an action, think
about <em>all</em> of the actions a player might take. Think about all
of the configurations the various objects might get into. Also, think
about how any other characters in the room would naturally react when
the PC does something or other.</p>

<h3 id="every-turn-rules">Every Turn Rules</h3>

<p>We’ve already seen a couple of examples of Every Turn rules. As you
can guess from the name of the rule, an Every Turn rule is consulted
every turn to see whether it would like to do anything. This rule is
consulted as the <em>last</em> step in the process that starts when the
player types a command. The output of an Every Turn rule will normally
appear at the bottom of a block of text in the game, after the
description of whatever happens as a result of the player’s latest
command.</p>

<p>An Every Turn rule can print out some text, or it can do something
more complicated. Printing out some text is a nice way to add atmosphere
to your game, but a message that prints every turn will quickly become
annoying. Here’s an Every Turn rule that adds atmosphere to a forest
setting in a slightly more interesting way. Sometimes it chooses a
random text to print, and sometimes it does nothing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn:\n\tif a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:\n\t\tsay &quot;[one of]A dragonfly darts past you.[or]You hear a frog croaking.[or]A bird chirps in the bushes.[or]The breeze rustles the leaves.[at random]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]A dragonfly darts past you.[or]You hear a frog croaking.[or]A bird chirps in the bushes.[or]The breeze rustles the leaves.[at random]".</div>
</div>

<p>But even with a bit of randomness, this type of Every Turn rule will
get boring before very long. A better solution is to write an Every Turn
rule that only runs when a certain scene is happening, or when the
player is in a certain region. If we have defined the Forest Area as a
region, we could rewrite the rule above like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn when the player is in the Forest Area:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn when the player is in the Forest Area:</div>
</div>

<p>If we’ve created a scene called Forest Explorations, we could do it
this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn during Forest Explorations:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn during Forest Explorations:</div>
</div>

<p>In fact, if you’re concerned about writing efficient code so that
your game won’t be sluggish when played in the current generation of Web
browsers (and this is something to be concerned about), qualifying your
Every Turn rules in this way, so that they’re only consulted by the game
when specific scenes are active, is a good idea.</p>

<p>We can also write an Every Turn rule that will produce some narrative
or background text at specific points within a scene. Here, the phrase
“exactly three turns” will insure that the output text is produced only
once (unless the scene is recurring, in which case it will be produced
once per recurrence):</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn:\n\tif Saucer Menace has been happening for exactly three turns:\n\t\tsay &quot;You hear an odd glorping noise somewhere nearby.&quot;;\n\totherwise if Saucer Menace has been happening for exactly five turns:\n\t\tsay &quot;Was that a tentacle you saw slithering out of sight?&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Saucer Menace has been happening for exactly three turns:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You hear an odd glorping noise somewhere nearby.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if Saucer Menace has been happening for exactly five turns:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Was that a tentacle you saw slithering out of sight?"</div>
</div>

<p>An Every Turn rule can also wait quietly in the background, checking
for a certain set of conditions, and then do something when the
conditions are met. Here’s a simple game that shows how the idea might
work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Throne Room is a room. &quot;The king&apos;s golden throne stands here.&quot;\n\nThe golden throne is an enterable scenery supporter in the Throne Room. The description is &quot;A magnificent golden throne.&quot;\n\nThe jewelled sceptre is here. The sparkling crown is here. The crown is wearable.\n\nEvery turn:\n\tif the player wears the sparkling crown and the player carries the jewelled sceptre and the player is on the golden throne:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;re the king!!!&quot;;\n\t\tend the story saying “Congratulations!”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Throne Room is a room. "The king's golden throne stands here."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The golden throne is an enterable scenery supporter in the Throne Room. The description is "A magnificent golden throne."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The jewelled sceptre is here. The sparkling crown is here. The crown is wearable.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player wears the sparkling crown and the player carries the jewelled sceptre and the player is on the golden throne:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You're the king!!!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “Congratulations!”</div>
</div>

<p>Every turn, this rule checks to see whether the player has done all
three things that are needed to win: the player has to be carrying the
sceptre and wearing the crown while sitting on the throne. You could get
the same results using After rules for three different actions (after
taking the sceptre, after wearing the crown, and entering the throne),
and test in each of the After rules for whether the other two conditions
were satisfied &ndash; but using an Every Turn rule is less likely to lead to
a bug, because you can test all three conditions in one place. And if
you need to edit the code for some reason, you only need to edit it in
one place; you don’t need to hunt for every spot in the code where that
condition is being checked.</p>

<p>Here’s another way to get the same result:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn when the player is on the golden throne:\n\tif the player wears the sparkling crown and the player carries the jewelled sceptre:\n\t\tsay &quot;You&apos;re the king!!!&quot;;\n\t\tend the story saying “Congratulations!”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn when the player is on the golden throne:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player wears the sparkling crown and the player carries the jewelled sceptre:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You're the king!!!";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying “Congratulations!”</div>
</div>

<p>As this example shows, an Every Turn rule can include a test in its
first line. If we’re writing a game in which the player needs to eat
periodically, we might do something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A person can be hungry or not hungry. A person is usually not hungry.\nThe player has a number called hunger-level. The hunger-level of the player is 0.\nEvery turn when the player is hungry:\n\tincrease the hunger-level of the player by 1;\n\tsay &quot;[one of]Your stomach is rumbling.[or]You&apos;re becoming quite hungry.[or]You&apos;re very hungry. You need to find food soon.[or]You&apos;re practically starving![stopping]&quot;;\n\tif the hunger-level of the player is 7:\n\t\tend the story saying &quot;You have starved to death!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A person can be hungry or not hungry. A person is usually not hungry.</div>
<div class="codeline">The player has a number called hunger-level. The hunger-level of the player is 0.</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the player is hungry:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the hunger-level of the player by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[one of]Your stomach is rumbling.[or]You're becoming quite hungry.[or]You're very hungry. You need to find food soon.[or]You're practically starving![stopping]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the hunger-level of the player is 7:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying "You have starved to death!"</div>
</div>

<p>Switching the player to hungry would happen elsewhere in the code. In
this example we’ve added something new &ndash; a counter (hunger-level) that
keeps track of how long the player has been hungry, and ends the game
after a set number of turns. When the player eats food, your code would
both switch the player to not hungry and reset the hunger-level of the
player to 0.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="chapter-9-phrasing-punctuation">Chapter 9: Phrasing &amp; Punctuation</h2>

<p>In this chapter we’re going to
look at the guidelines you’ll need to follow when writing your game in
the Inform 7 language. Most programmers refer to what they write as
“source code.” <em>Writing with Inform</em> refers to what you’ll be
writing as the “source text,” but the only reason I can see for using
this nonstandard term is to make Inform look less intimidating to the
new author. What you’ll be writing will be source code, and that’s the
term used in this book. (In fact, calling the code “source text” is
potentially confusing, in that Inform has a data type called text, which
is only one of the many components of the language.)</p>

<p>If you’ve ever learned a traditional computer programming language,
you may be surprised when you first look at the syntax of the Inform
language. (“Syntax” is just a fancy word for how things are phrased and
punctuated.) At first glance, Inform looks very little like a
programming language; it looks like plain written English. Some of the
sentences are a little forced, but English syntax is the foundation of
Inform.</p>

<p>This is an illusion &ndash; artful, but an illusion. Just like any other
programming language, Inform has a compiler. And like any other
compiler, the Inform compiler absolutely insists that your code be
written in certain ways. The “natural language” user interface of Inform
is not much more than skin-deep.</p>

<p>The use of “natural language” for programming is both a blessing and
a curse. It’s a blessing because if you don’t remember how to do some
type of task, you can try writing it exactly the way you’d phrase it if
you were speaking to a friend. Sometimes you’ll find the right phrase
that way. Or not. Many phrases that are understood without trouble by
native speakers of English are <em>not</em> understood by Inform.
Sometimes there are three or four different ways to express a given
concept that for a native English speaker would mean exactly the same
thing, so you’re pretty much guaranteed to hit the target before very
long. At other times, syntax that you might naturally expect to work,
won’t, and you’ll have to hunt around in the Documentation to find the
correct syntax.</p>

<p>A second surprise, for expert programmers, may come from the sheer
number of phrase constructions that are both allowed and needed by
Inform. Inform is a language that’s rich in features. As you write
interactive fiction, you’ll be dealing with innumerable specifics &ndash; odd
connections between rooms, objects that need to behave in unexpected
ways, in-game error messages that need to be customized due to the
nature of the story, and so on. Interactive fiction is a mass of
particulars; generalizations are hard to come by, and even harder to
nail down. But let’s give it a shot.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-source-text">Types of Source Text</h3>

<p>There are three main kinds of writing in Inform. First, some of your
writing will be between double quotation marks, “Like this.” There are
two types of things that you put between quotation marks: what you want
your game to print out to the computer screen (at some point or other)
when the game is played, and words and phrases that you want Inform to
understand when the player types them. Here’s a quick example that shows
both of these types:</p>

  <div class="codeline">The will is on the end table. The description is "A legal-looking piece of paper. You can't read what's on it, because it's upside down."</div>
  
<div class="codeline">Understand "legal", "legal-looking", "document", "paper", "piece", and</div>
<div class="codeline">"piece of" as the will.</div>
</div>

<p>The sentence following “The description is” is output text. This is
what the Inform game interpreter will print out in response to EXAMINE
THE WILL. The words after “Understand” are different: They’re extra
vocabulary words for the object whose main name is “will”. The word
“will” can be used both by the player of the game when referring to this
object, and by the author. However, only the player can call it a
“document” or a “piece of paper.”</p>

<p>The function of Understand rules is sometimes a bit difficult for new
Inform authors to grasp, so let’s expand on the idea a bit. If you’ve
used the code above to create an object called the will, you can
<em>only</em> refer to it in your source code as “the will” (or just
“will”). You can’t write rules such as this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of examining the legal document: [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of examining the legal document: [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>Why not? Because the compiler doesn’t know that this object can be
called “legal document.” In your source code, it’s important always to
refer to an object using the word or words you used to create it. A
little later in this chapter, we’ll look at a gray area that affects
this concept, but it’s an important concept to get straight. If you
forget what you called an object, you can even end up creating a second
object with almost the same name, which can lead to hard-to-find bugs in
your code.</p>

<p>The second type of thing you’ll write will be <em>comments</em>.
Words and sentences that are <em>not</em> between quotation marks but
are instead surrounded by square brackets, [Like this], are comments.
When your game is compiled, the comments will be ignored. Adding
comments to your code is highly recommended! A comment is a memo you
write to yourself, in order to take notes about things you still need to
add to the story or so that you’ll remember, six months from now, why
your code is constructed in a certain way.</p>

<p>As explained below in the section “Text Insertions,” however, square
brackets have a completely different meaning when they’re
<em>inside</em> double-quotes.</p>

<p>Third, any writing that’s not between quotation marks and not
surrounded by square brackets consists of instructions to the computer
on how you want your game to operate &ndash; code, in other words.</p>

<p>With some minor exceptions, which we’ll get to below, Inform does not
care what you put between quotation marks. You can write amazing poetry,
if you feel up to it, and become known as a writer of rare gifts. Or you
can spell words wrong, use clumsy grammar, and indulge in sloppy
punctuation. In the latter case, the people who play your game may think
you’re careless or badly educated, but these mistakes won’t matter to
Inform. Inform won’t even notice them. It will just say, “Oh, that’s the
text that I’m supposed to print out now.” No problem.</p>

<p>Text that’s neither a comment nor in quotes is a completely different
matter. Inform will insist that you spell words correctly, that you
follow certain rules for how phrases are worded, and that you use the
right punctuation in every single line. Even a single mistake will stop
Inform dead in its tracks. For instance, you might accidentally type a
colon (:) instead of a semicolon (;) or vice-versa. This is easy to do,
because they share a single computer key and look almost alike on the
screen (especially when the screen is set to high resolution). But the
colon and semicolon have completely different meanings to Inform. If you
mix them up, when you click the Go! button to compile the game you’ll
see nothing but Problem messages. See the previous discussion of a few <a
href="#Ref_common_coding_problems">common coding problems</a>.</p>

<p>In this chapter we’ll look at the main rules you need to follow when
writing your source code. It’s not easy to set out a complete set of
rules for you to follow, because there are so many different things you
may want to do while writing interactive fiction. Inform has lots of
features, some of which require special types of syntax.</p>

<p>The I7 Documentation gives fairly complete explanations of the
syntax, but it’s spread out in a lot of different places. Each type of
syntax is discussed on the page where a feature that uses that syntax is
introduced. In order to gather all of this information in one place,
we’ll have to refer to some Inform features that you may not have run
into. Don’t worry if you don’t understand every detail: This chapter is
partly for you to refer to when you’re trying to figure out why Inform
doesn’t want to compile your game.</p>

<h3 id="text-insertions">Text Insertions</h3>

<p>It’s extremely common for the game to need to make some decisions
about what to print while the game is being played. The ways to do this
are well described in <a href="../WI_5.html">Chapter 5 of <em>Writing with
Inform</em>, “Text”</a>, but we’ll look at a couple of examples here.</p>

<p>In our first example, a ceramic bowl can be broken or unbroken. If
it’s broken, the description should obviously change. You can use square
brackets to embed if/otherwise tests in the description of the bowl,
like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The ceramic bowl is on the end table. The ceramic bowl can be broken\nor unbroken. The description is &quot;The delicate ceramic bowl is [if\nbroken]chipped and cracked[otherwise]a beautiful work of art[end if].&quot;\nUnderstand &quot;delicate&quot; as the ceramic bowl. Understand &quot;chipped&quot; and\n&quot;cracked&quot; as the ceramic bowl when the bowl is broken.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The ceramic bowl is on the end table. The ceramic bowl can be broken</div>
<div class="codeline">or unbroken. The description is "The delicate ceramic bowl is [if</div>
<div class="codeline">broken]chipped and cracked[otherwise]a beautiful work of art[end if]."</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "delicate" as the ceramic bowl. Understand "chipped" and</div>
<div class="codeline">"cracked" as the ceramic bowl when the bowl is broken.</div>
</div>

<p>I’ve also created an Understand sentence that adds “chipped” and
“cracked” as vocabulary &ndash; but only when the bowl is broken. The main
point of this example, though, is the insertion of “[if broken]”,
“[otherwise]”, and “[end if]” in the description. (And by the way,
Inform accepts “else” as a synonym for “otherwise.” Less typing.) Notice
that the period that ends the sentence is <em>after</em> the [end if].
The period will always print out, no matter whether the bowl is broken
or unbroken. This is the way I prefer to write if/otherwise/end if
blocks in my games, but you can also do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;The delicate ceramic bowl is [if broken]chipped\nand cracked.[otherwise]a beautiful work of art.[end if]&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "The delicate ceramic bowl is [if broken]chipped</div>
<div class="codeline">and cracked.[otherwise]a beautiful work of art.[end if]".</div>
</div>

<p>Here, I’ve moved the period inside the if/otherwise text. So I also
have to add a separate period <em>after</em> the close-quote, to let
Inform know that the description sentence is finished. The advantage of
doing it the first way is that the period just before the close-quote
does double duty: Inform both prints it (because it’s part of the output
text) and understands it as ending the sentence that begins “The
description is”.</p>

<p>When a period, question mark, or exclamation point falls at the very
end of a text block, just before the closing quotation mark, Inform
understands that the punctuation mark both ends the sentence within
quotes <em>and</em> ends the larger context of the surrounding code. For
example, here’s an error:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of ringing the bell:\n\tsay &quot;The bell produces only a dull thud.&quot;\n\tnow the butler is suspicious. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of ringing the bell:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bell produces only a dull thud."</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the butler is suspicious. [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>This code won’t compile. The problem is that the line beginning with
“say” ends with a period. As a result, Inform thinks the Instead rule is
finished &ndash; so the third line doesn’t seem (to the compiler) to belong to
a rule at all. It’s just floating in code-space, not attached to
anything. If we need to continue with more lines of code after a
close-quote like this, we need to tack on a semicolon to tell the
compiler that we’re not done yet:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of ringing the bell:\n\tsay &quot;The bell produces only a dull thud.&quot;;\n\tnow the butler is suspicious. [Now the code will compile, because we\nadded a semicolon.]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of ringing the bell:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bell produces only a dull thud.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the butler is suspicious. [Now the code will compile, because we</div>
<div class="codeline">added a semicolon.]</div>
</div>

<p>A tidy way to deal with this is to put the other parts of the rule
<em>before</em> the quoted output text. If you get in the habit of doing
this, you won’t need to worry about adding extra punctuation. Here’s how
the revised rule would look:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of ringing the bell:\n\tnow the butler is suspicious;\n\tsay &quot;The bell produces only a dull thud.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of ringing the bell:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the butler is suspicious;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bell produces only a dull thud."</div>
</div>

<p>But we were talking about text insertions, not about periods. You can
string together several tests within a single block of output text by
using “[otherwise if &hellip;]”, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The ceramic bowl can be intact, chipped, or shattered. The\ndescription is &quot;The delicate ceramic bowl is [if intact]a beautiful work\nof art[otherwise if chipped]slightly damaged[otherwise]shattered into\nshards[end if].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The ceramic bowl can be intact, chipped, or shattered. The</div>
<div class="codeline">description is "The delicate ceramic bowl is [if intact]a beautiful work</div>
<div class="codeline">of art[otherwise if chipped]slightly damaged[otherwise]shattered into</div>
<div class="codeline">shards[end if]."</div>
</div>

<p>You’ll notice that we don’t have to tell Inform <em>what</em> object
we’re asking “if intact” about. Inform knows that, by default, the
object being examined is the one whose properties are being tested. We
could test something entirely different, though, if we wanted to:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;[if the curator is in the location]The bowl looks\nquite valuable, but you don’t dare get close enough to give it a good\ninspection, not while the curator is hovering nearby, looking\nnervous[otherwise]The bowl is a Ming Dynasty vase, clearly worth\nmillions[end if].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "[if the curator is in the location]The bowl looks</div>
<div class="codeline">quite valuable, but you don’t dare get close enough to give it a good</div>
<div class="codeline">inspection, not while the curator is hovering nearby, looking</div>
<div class="codeline">nervous[otherwise]The bowl is a Ming Dynasty vase, clearly worth</div>
<div class="codeline">millions[end if]."</div>
</div>

<p>What we can’t do is embed one if-test inside another. This type of
thing won’t work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;[if intact][if the curator is in the location]You\ndon&apos;t want to appear too interested in the bowl while the curator is\nhovering about[end if]The bowl appears to be a priceless Ming Dynasty\nvase[otherwise if the bowl is chipped][if the curator is in the\nlocation] ...&quot;. [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "[if intact][if the curator is in the location]You</div>
<div class="codeline">don't want to appear too interested in the bowl while the curator is</div>
<div class="codeline">hovering about[end if]The bowl appears to be a priceless Ming Dynasty</div>
<div class="codeline">vase[otherwise if the bowl is chipped][if the curator is in the</div>
<div class="codeline">location] &hellip;". [Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>When you need to test several conditions at once while assembling an
output text, the most convenient and reliable way to do it is to use a
To Say statement. We might write a To Say statement for our ceramic bowl
like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The ceramic bowl is on the end table. The ceramic bowl can be intact, chipped, or shattered. The description is &quot;[bowl-desc].&quot;\n\nTo say bowl-desc:\n\tif the bowl is intact:\n\t\tif the curator is in the location:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You don&apos;t want to appear too interested in the bowl while the curator is hovering about&quot;;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;The bowl appears to be a priceless Ming Dynasty vase&quot;;\n\totherwise if the bowl is chipped:\n\t\tsay &quot;The bowl is slightly chipped&quot;;\n\t\tif the curator is in the location:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;, as you know only too well, having chipped it yourself. The curator is guarding it jealously&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;The bowl is shattered beyond repair&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The ceramic bowl is on the end table. The ceramic bowl can be intact, chipped, or shattered. The description is "[bowl-desc]."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say bowl-desc:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the bowl is intact:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the curator is in the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You don't want to appear too interested in the bowl while the curator is hovering about";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bowl appears to be a priceless Ming Dynasty vase";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if the bowl is chipped:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bowl is slightly chipped";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the curator is in the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say ", as you know only too well, having chipped it yourself. The curator is guarding it jealously";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The bowl is shattered beyond repair".</div>
</div>

<p>Notice the slightly unusual way those “say” lines are formatted. None
of them ends with a period inside the close-quote. This is because the
period that ends the description is up above, in the description
property for the ceramic bowl. When you use a To Say rule in this way,
you need to be especially careful about where the period is that ends
the last sentence. This is because Inform does some special output
formatting when it hits the end of a quoted sentence or paragraph. If
the period is in the wrong place, a blank line can disappear from the
output, or an extra blank line can be added.</p>


<p>You can put any word you want in double-quoted text using brackets,
as shown above, and then write a To Say statement that will run when the
bracketed word is reached. Hyphenated compound words, such as
“bowl-desc”, are a good choice, because they’re unlikely to be used
anywhere else in your code.</p>

<p>Normally a To Say statement should always be called from within text
that’s going to be printed out in the game. This type of thing is legal,
but usually not a good idea:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After attacking the ceramic bowl:\n\tsay &quot;[another-code-block]&quot;.\n\nTo say another-code-block:\n\tif the ceramic bowl is shattered:\n\t\t[more code goes here...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After attacking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[another-code-block]".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say another-code-block:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the ceramic bowl is shattered:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[more code goes here&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>Instead of using “say”, a better way to call a separate code block,
if you need to do it, is just to create it using a To statement, like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After attacking the ceramic bowl:\n\tsound the alarm.\n\nTo sound the alarm:\n\tif the ceramic bowl is shattered:\n\t\t[more code goes here...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After attacking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sound the alarm.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To sound the alarm:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the ceramic bowl is shattered:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[more code goes here&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>But there’s no requirement that the To Say rule actually print any
text to the game’s output. Once in a while you may want to cause
something to happen as part of a text output. Here’s a simple example &ndash;
we’re going to adjust this NPC’s mood when you ask him to give you an
object:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Alexander Button can be friendly, neutral, or hostile. Alexander Button is neutral.\n\nInstead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\tsay &quot;[Alexander-less-friendly]Alexander laughs at you.&quot;\n\nTo say Alexander-less-friendly:\n\tif Alexander is friendly:\n\t\tnow Alexander is neutral;\n\totherwise if Alexander is neutral:\n\t\tnow Alexander is hostile.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Alexander Button can be friendly, neutral, or hostile. Alexander Button is neutral.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[Alexander-less-friendly]Alexander laughs at you."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say Alexander-less-friendly:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Alexander is friendly:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now Alexander is neutral;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if Alexander is neutral:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now Alexander is hostile.</div>
</div>

<p>In this example, the text output “Alexander laughs at you” includes a
call to a To Say rule that prints nothing. It has only one effect: it
causes Alexander to become less friendly by adjusting one of his
properties. In this case, you could get the same result using a To
phrase, as shown earlier in this section, by adding a line like “crank
up Alexander’s hostility” in the Instead rule &ndash; but there are times
(such as when printing text that’s stored in a table) when using a To
Say statement is really the best way to do it.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="switchable-markup">Switchable Markup</h4>

<p>As explained in <a href="../WI_5.html#section_9">WI 5.9</a>, you can switch bold and italic type on and off within the
quoted text in a “say” statement. You might want to do this, for
instance, to draw the player’s attention to items in a room description
if the item can be examined or otherwise manipulated. This effect can be
helpful to new players, but it can annoy experienced players. So we’d
like to let the player switch it on or off.</p>

<p>The extension called <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/9.3/Aaron%20Reed/Keyword%20Interface.i7x">Keyword Interface by Aaron Reed</a> does this kind
of thing, and a lot more besides. Here’s a simple way to do it without
Keyword Interface, which may be all you need:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Using-bold is a truth state that varies.

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Patio is a room. "In the pavement is set a small iron [b]grate[/b]."</div>
</div>

<p>Now we would see:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p class="bold">Patio</p>
<p>In the pavement is set a small iron grate.</p>
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>bold on</div>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>look</div>
<p class="bold">Patio</p>
<p>In the pavement is set a small iron <span class="bold">grate</span>.
</div>


<p>The key to understanding this code is in the blocks that begin “To
say b:” and “To say /b:” These test whether the truth state using-bold
is true or false. Once we’ve set things up properly, we can use the text
insertions “[b]” and “[/b]” to mark any item that we want highlighted
with boldface type &ndash; and the player will be able to control the effect
using a simple utility command.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="quotes-within-quotes">Quotes Within Quotes</h4>

<p>When you start writing NPC conversations, it’s easy to forget that
the quotation marks surrounding your text won’t be printed out. This,
for instance, is an error:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\tsay &quot;I would never give it to you!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>

<p>Here’s the output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>ask alexander for will</div>

<p>I would never give it to you!</p>
</div>

<p>This reads like a response from the parser (that is, from the game
itself), not from Alexander. The correct way to do it is using single
quotes within the double quotes, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;I would never give it to you!&apos;&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'I would never give it to you!'"</div>
</div>

<p>This produces a better output:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>ask alexander for will</div>

<p>"I would never give it to you!"</p>
</div>

<p>Now the player can see that it’s Alexander talking. A better writing
style would be to include a <em>dialog tag</em> in the text:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;I would never give it to you!&apos; he replies with a sneer.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "'I would never give it to you!' he replies with a sneer."</div>
</div>

<p>As explained in <a href="../WI_2.html#section_3">WI 2.3 Punctuation</a>, Inform will automatically turn single quotes
into double quotes when formatting its output. But this raises a
potential problem &ndash; how to handle apostrophes. If an apostrophe is in
the middle of a word, Inform will understand that it’s an apostrophe,
and won’t turn it into a double quote when outputting the text:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\nsay &quot;&apos;I&apos;d never give it to you!&apos; he replies with a sneer.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "'I'd never give it to you!' he replies with a sneer."</div>
</div>

<p>Here, the word “I’d” will be printed correctly. But if the apostrophe
is at the end of a word, as in some types of dialect and informal
speech, Inform will get confused:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\nsay &quot;&apos;I&apos;m not givin&apos; it to you!&apos; he replies with a sneer.&quot;\n[Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "'I'm not givin' it to you!' he replies with a sneer."</div>
<div class="codeline">[Error!]</div>
</div>

<p>This code will put a quotation mark after the word givin. To get an
apostrophe into the output at the end of the word givin’, we have to put
brackets around it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:\n\nsay &quot;&apos;I&apos;m not givin[&apos;] it to you!&apos; he replies with a sneer.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of asking Alexander Button for the will:</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "'I'm not givin['] it to you!' he replies with a sneer."</div>
</div>

<div class="sidebar" id="extra-and-missing-blank-lines-in-output">
<h4>Extra &amp; Missing Blank Lines in Output</h4>

<p>A frequent problem for beginning Inform authors is that the game
output has either too many blank lines in it, or not enough of them. The
biggest cause of this is periods not being placed correctly at the ends
of double-quoted text blocks. When you start inserting if-tests and
alternate blocks into your text, this problem is more likely to show up.
To avoid this situation, think logically, scrutinize your code, and test
it under all of the conditions that can arise.</p>

<p>Three instructions are available to help you fiddle with the line
breaks if you need to. You can use [line break], [paragraph break], or
[run paragraph on]. All of these are worth knowing about. They’re
discussed in <a href="../WI_5.html#section_8">WI 5.8</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="breaking-up-paragraphs">Breaking Up Paragraphs</h3>

<p>If you write a description (most likely, a room description) that
runs on for several paragraphs, you can separate the paragraphs within a
single double-quoted block by using two Return/Enter key presses, like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Desolate Moor is a room. &quot;A gloomy treeless waste stretches out\non all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient menace.\n\nCloser to hand, a crumbling castle stands.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Desolate Moor is a room. "A gloomy treeless waste stretches out</div>
<div class="codeline">on all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient menace.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Closer to hand, a crumbling castle stands."</div>
</div>

<p>When the game is played, there will be a standard paragraph break
(that is, a blank line) before the sentence, “Closer to hand&hellip;”.</p>

<p>Another way to get the same effect is with the text insertion
“[paragraph break]”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Desolate Moor is a room. &quot;A gloomy treeless waste stretches out on all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient menace.[paragraph break]Closer to hand, a crumbling castle stands.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Desolate Moor is a room. "A gloomy treeless waste stretches out on all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient menace.[paragraph break]Closer to hand, a crumbling castle stands."</div>
</div>

<p>This is a better, safer way to break up multiple paragraphs when the
text appears in tables and conversation responses. Note that there is no
space after “break]”. We want the next paragraph to begin at the left
margin. A space character in quoted text will always be printed.</p>

<p>Speaking of the left margin, some authors would prefer to use
book-style text, in which paragraphs are indented rather than being
separated by vertical blank space. Most interactive fiction doesn’t use
this style. If you want to do it (I don’t recommend it), here’s how:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Desolate Moor is a room. &quot;[tab]A gloomy treeless waste stretches\nout on all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient\nmenace.[line break][tab]Closer to hand, a crumbling castle stands.&quot;\n\nTo say tab:\n\tsay &quot; &quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The Desolate Moor is a room. "[tab]A gloomy treeless waste stretches</div>
<div class="codeline">out on all sides. A few rocky outcrops add an air of ancient</div>
<div class="codeline">menace.[line break][tab]Closer to hand, a crumbling castle stands."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say tab:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say " ".</div>
</div>

<p>Occasionally you may need to write two separate “say” statements and
have them printed together, without a paragraph break. In this case, the
tool of choice is to end the first with “[run paragraph on]”. Here’s a
handy little utility that illustrates the use of “[run paragraph on]”:
If the player picks up something without having examined it, the
description is automatically tacked onto the output after the word
“Taken.”</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A thing can be examined or unexamined.\nAfter taking something unexamined: \n\tsay &quot;Taken. [run paragraph on]&quot;; \n\ttry examining the noun.\nCarry out examining something: \n\tnow the noun is examined.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A thing can be examined or unexamined.</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking something unexamined: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Taken. [run paragraph on]"; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try examining the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out examining something: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the noun is examined.</div>
</div>

<p>This code creates a new property of all things, the property
“examined”, and sets the property whenever a thing is examined. But the
point of the example is this: If “[run paragraph on]” isn’t included,
the description of the thing that’s picked up will be on a separate
line. It will look more natural if it follows immediately after the word
“Taken.” is printed. Try it both ways to see the results for
yourself.</p>

<h3 id="large-text-blocks">Large Text Blocks</h3>

<p>Inform has an upper limit of about 3,000 characters on how much text
can be included between quotation marks as a single chunk. You might run
into this limit, for instance, while writing a long intro to your story
(which many players frown on) or while writing an explanation for new
players of how to play IF (a courteous and useful thing to do).</p>

<p>The way to work around this limit is to create an object and give it
several properties that are all blocks of text. Here’s the intro of my
game “A Flustered Duck” &ndash; not the intro itself, but the structure I
created to print it out:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`When play begins: say &quot;[intro-1 of the text-holder][intro-2 of the\ntext-holder][intro-3 of the text-holder]&quot;.\n\nThe text-holder is a thing.

Elliott!

[...and\nso on...]”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">When play begins: say "[intro-1 of the text-holder][intro-2 of the</div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">intro-1 of the text-holder is "'Elliott! Elliott! Where are you,</div>

<div class="codeline">drowsy contemplation of a moth that has blundered into the barn and is</div>
<div class="codeline">flitting aimlessly about, trying to find its way back outdoors. [&hellip;and</div>
<div class="codeline">so on&hellip;]”</div>
</div>
<h3 id="white-space">White Space</h3>

<p>When you’re writing a game in Inform, does white space in your code
matter? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Because Inform is designed to look
like “natural language,” its use of white space is a little trickier
than in some other programming languages.</p>

<p>Places where white space matters include around headings (see
“Headings,” later in this chapter) and when you’re using Tab characters
to organize tables and logical blocks of code (see “Indentation”).</p>

<p>Each heading must have a blank line before it and a blank line after
it. The line containing the story title and byline (on the first line of
the Source file) must also have a blank line after it. The items within
a table row must be separated by at least one Tab character, but you can
add extra Tabs or more spaces if you like; they’ll just be ignored.</p>

<p>When copying blocks of source code from one place to anotehr, such as
to or from an email reader or a forum post being displayed in a Web
browser, you need to be aware that some programs of this sort
automatically turn Tabs into rows of spaces. The text will look the same
on the screen &ndash; but if Inform is expecting a Tab, it won’t understand
the text anymore!</p>

<p>White space is preserved in double-quoted text when it is output to
the screen during the game, so when you start adding conditional code
within double-quoted text, you need to be careful to put spaces only
where you want them. For instance, this is a text formatting
mistake:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The description is &quot;The bowl is [if intact] a priceless treasure\n[otherwise] badly damaged [end if].&quot; [Mistake!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The description is "The bowl is [if intact] a priceless treasure</div>
<div class="codeline">[otherwise] badly damaged [end if]." [Mistake!]</div>
</div>

<p>Can you see what will happen? It looks easier to read in the source
code, because we’ve separated the [] blocks by putting spaces on both
sides … but when the text is printed out in the game, there will be two
spaces after “is” and a space before the final period. Technically, we
might not call this a bug, since your game will run perfectly, but there
will be extra spaces in the sentence that appears in the game.</p>

<p>In writing source code, you definitely need to put white space around
words. Borrowing from the example in the section on “Text Insertions,”
above, this will work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say bowl-desc:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To say bowl-desc:</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;but this obviously won’t:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Tosaybowl-desc:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Tosaybowl-desc:</div>
</div>

<p>There’s no penalty for adding extra spaces, however. This will work,
though there’s no reason to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To &ensp;&ensp;say\tbowl-desc&ensp;:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To &ensp;&ensp;say&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;bowl-desc&ensp;:</div>
</div>

<p>In some situations, you can insert one extra carriage return (an
old-fashioned term, but still useful &ndash; it means, “you can start a new
line at the left margin”), but not two returns. If there’s an empty
line, Inform won’t like it. This will work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say\nbowl-desc:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To say</div>
<div class="codeline">bowl-desc:</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;but this won’t:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say\n\nbowl-desc:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To say</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">bowl-desc:</div>
</div>

<p>In many other situations, white space doesn’t matter. As far as
Inform is concerned, each sentence (that is, each block of code that
ends with a period) stands on its own. You don’t even need to put a
space after the period. And if the sentence is followed by a blank line,
you don’t need to end the sentence with a period either. So these five
ways of writing a pair of sentences are exactly the same, and all of
them will work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing.Understand &quot;paint&quot; as\npainting. [No space after period]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing.Understand "paint" as</div>
<div class="codeline">painting. [No space after period]</div>
</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing. Understand &quot;paint&quot; as\npainting. [Space after period.]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing. Understand "paint" as</div>
<div class="codeline">painting. [Space after period.]</div>
</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing.\n\nUnderstand &quot;paint&quot; as painting.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "paint" as painting.</div>
</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing.\n\nUnderstand &quot;paint&quot; as painting.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "paint" as painting.</div>
</div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing\n\nUnderstand &quot;paint&quot; as painting [No periods.]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "paint" as painting [No periods.]</div>
</div>

<p>But this won’t:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Painting is an action applying to nothing\n\nUnderstand &quot;paint&quot; as painting\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>
<div class="codeline">[ doesn't work! ]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Painting is an action applying to nothing</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand "paint" as painting</div>
</div>

<p>If Inform doesn’t see a period and doesn’t see a blank line either,
it thinks you’ve written one long continuous statement. As a result, it
can’t compile the code.</p>

<p>Blank lines can’t be used within code blocks, however. This won’t
compile:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of looking when the location is the hall of mirrors:\n\n\tif the player is invisible:\n\n\t\tsay &quot;It feels weird to look in the mirrors and not see your handsome features reflected back.&quot; [Errors!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of looking when the location is the hall of mirrors:</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is invisible:</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "It feels weird to look in the mirrors and not see your handsome features reflected back." [Errors!]</div>
</div>

<h3 id="objects-vs.-rules">Objects vs. Rules</h3>

<p>Many computer programming languages are firmly based on the idea of
objects. Even if you’re creating something as abstract as an email
program, every button or icon on the screen and every window that opens
will probably be a separate object within the software. The technical
definition of “object” doesn’t matter at the moment: You can just think
of a software object as a bunch of related code.</p>

<p>As you write with Inform, you’ll be creating lots of software
objects. Usually these will correspond to objects in the model world. A
tree, for instance, would almost always be modeled using an object. In
fact, it would be a <em>thing,</em> which is a kind of object. But
Inform is unusual in that it isn’t as object-oriented as many
programming languages. If you have some experience programming in
another language, you may be dismayed at first to find that some types
of data can be created either as free-floating global values or as
properties of objects.</p>

<p>It really doesn’t matter which type of data you use, because all of
the data properties of objects are public. They have global scope. (If
you’ve never done any object-oriented programming, this paragraph will
make no sense to you. Feel free to ignore it.) Also, objects in Inform
don’t have methods. All functions are global, although they can be
written in such a way as to apply only to one object.</p>

<p>Instead of calling methods on objects, Inform uses rules and
rulebooks. When you write rules in Inform, for the most part you can put
them wherever you’d like in the source. When your game is compiled,
Inform will collect all of the rules you’ve written and all of the rules
in the extensions you’ve included, and assemble them all into
rulebooks.</p>

<p>When a rulebook is consulted during gameplay, Inform will proceed
downward through the list of rules in the rulebook. When it finds a rule
that applies to the current action, it will follow the rule. If the rule
makes a decision (that is, if it ends with “rule succeeds”, “rule
fails”, or “stop the action”), Inform will stop. Otherwise, it will
continue on through the rulebook, and then perhaps proceed to other
rulebooks in the action-processing sequence, as shown in <a href="../WI_12.html#section_2">WI 12.2</a>.</p>

<p>The rulebooks are constructed by the compiler according to certain
principles. If you’re curious how this works, you should definitely read
<a href="../WI_19.html">Chapter 19</strong> of <em>Writing with Inform</em>,
“Rulebooks”</a>. Basically, rules that are more specific will be listed
earlier in the rulebook, while more general rules will be listed later.
For instance, a game might have these two rules:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of inserting something into an open container:\n\t[...more code would go here...]\n\nInstead of inserting something into the coffee cup:\n\t[...more code...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of inserting something into an open container:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;more code would go here&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of inserting something into the coffee cup:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;more code&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>When Inform constructs the Instead rulebook, it will put the rule
about inserting into the coffee cup <em>before</em> the rule about
inserting into an open container, because the rule about the coffee cup
is more specific &ndash; it relates only to one object, not to any container
that has the open property. When the game is being played, the Instead
rule for the coffee cup will be consulted first. It will (presumably)
end with a default “rule fails”, so action processing will halt. The
rule about inserting something into an open container will never be
reached.</p>

<p>As <a href="../WI_18.html#section_4">WI 18.4 Listing
rules explicitly</a> explains, we can tinker with the ordering of the
rules if we need to. We can tell Inform to put a rule first or last in a
rulebook, or before or after some other specific rule (if the latter
rule has a nam). If a rule has a name (and most of the rules in Inform’s
Standard Rules have names), we can unlist them like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The can&apos;t exceed carrying capacity rule is not listed in any\nrulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The can't exceed carrying capacity rule is not listed in any</div>
<div class="codeline">rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>Or we can replace an existing rule with our own named rule, like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The new carrying capacity rule is listed instead of the can&apos;t exceed\ncarrying capacity rule in the check taking rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The new carrying capacity rule is listed instead of the can't exceed</div>
<div class="codeline">carrying capacity rule in the check taking rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>If you need to figure out which rules (either the rules in the Inform
library, or rules in an extension, or new rules that you’ve written) are
causing a certain output in a situation in your game, use the RULES
command and then inspect what happens when you give the command that
causes that output. You can also open Inform’s Standard Rules using the
Open Extension command in Inform’s File menu, and search for specific
words &ndash; but whatever you do, <em>don’t edit this file!</em> The details
of Inform’s Standard Rules have been worked out through years of deep
thought, trial-and-error, and highly technical bug reports from
experienced authors. Even small changes will quite likely cause bad
things to happen.</p>

<p>The only reason to open the Standard Rules, other than simple
curiosity, would be to replace it. To do this, (1) copy the rule, (2)
paste it into your code, (3) give it a new name, (4) edit it as needed
in your code, and then (5) replace the old rule with your newly edited
version using code like the line shown above. Doing this is safe, and
it’s occasionally necessary, but it’s not something to try until you’ve
learned a lot about Inform &ndash; and even then, it’s not something to do
casually.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those who are curious about how the Standard Rules
operate, some of them simply refer to underlying code in Inform 6, which
is not to be found in the Standard Rules. The manner in which the Inform
7 compiler uses Inform 6 code is not something we can reasonably get
into in this <em>Handbook</em>, as it’s probably the most advanced topic
in Inform programming.</p>

<p>The Rules tab in the Index has some very nice tools for looking at
the rules in your game. You can even remove many of the Standard Rules
by clicking the “unlist” button, which will insert a line of code into
your game. Again, this is not an action to take casually, as the result
could be that your game misbehaves quite seriously in response to player
input. But it’s a useful tool to have when you need it.</p>

<h3 id="the-names-of-things-2">The Names of Things</h3>

<p>When you create a thing in your model world, the name you give it is
understood by both the compiler and the parser. Most of the time, this
is a convenient feature. But once in a while you may want to override
it. You can do this using the <span id="Ref_privately-named"
class="anchor"></span><strong>privately-named</strong> and
<strong>printed name</strong> properties. If you’ve read Chapter 2 of
this Handbook, you may recall that we looked at a problem that can crop
up if you try to name a room using a direction word. If you have a room
called Hut, for instance, creating another room called South of the Hut
is possible, as explained on <a href="../WI_3.html#section2">WI 3.2: Rooms and the map</a>, but it’s awkward.</p>

<p>I prefer to do it this way:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`South of the Hut is Hut-South-Side. The printed name of\nHut-South-Side is &quot;South of the Hut&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">South of the Hut is Hut-South-Side. The printed name of Hut-South-Side is "South of the Hut".</div>
</div>

<p>This will work nicely, but if you do it this way, you’ll have to call
the room Hut-South-Side each and every time you mention it in your
code.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, we’ll put a thing in this room:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The object22 is a privately-named thing in Hut-South-Side. The\ndescription is &quot;It&apos;s a beautiful little yellow flower.&quot; Understand\n&quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;little&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, and &quot;flower&quot; as object22. The printed\nname of object22 is &quot;yellow flower&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The object22 is a privately-named thing in Hut-South-Side. The description is "It's a beautiful little yellow flower." Understand "beautiful", "little", "yellow", and "flower" as object22. The printed name of object22 is "yellow flower".</div>
</div>

<p>This object can’t be referred to by the player as “object22”, because
it’s privately-named. In this case, there would be no reason not to
simply call the object “yellow flower” in your own code. But in some
situations, creating a privately-named object might be useful. If you do
so, remember to also give it a printed name.</p>

<p>As <a href="../WI_4.html#section10">WI 4.10: Conditions of things</a> shows, you can add variable output to a printed
name. Here are two ways to do it, either of which might be useful in
some situations:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The printed name of the ceramic bowl is &quot;[bowl-condition] ceramic\nbowl&quot;.\n\nThe printed name of the ceramic bowl is &quot;[if broken]broken [end\nif]ceramic bowl&quot;.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The printed name of the ceramic bowl is "[bowl-condition] ceramic bowl".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The printed name of the ceramic bowl is "[if broken]broken [end if]ceramic bowl".</div>
</div>
<h3 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h3>

<p>Inform is fussy about punctuation, but you have some options. In
conditional tests that have only one line, you can use a comma and then
go right on in the same line rather than hitting a colon, a return, and
adding another Tab indent. These two examples both work, and they do the
same thing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the ceramic bowl:\n\tif the bowl is shattered, say &quot;What would be the point?&quot;;\n\totherwise continue the action.\n\nInstead of taking the ceramic bowl:\n\tif the bowl is shattered:\n\t\tsay &quot;What would be the point?&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the bowl is shattered, say "What would be the point?";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of taking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the bowl is shattered:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "What would be the point?";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>Inform also lets us skip the indentation entirely and substitute the
word “begin” followed by a semicolon:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the ceramic bowl:\nif the bowl is shattered begin;\nsay &quot;What would be the point?&quot;;\notherwise;\ncontinue the action;\nend if.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">if the bowl is shattered begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "What would be the point?";</div>
<div class="codeline">otherwise;</div>
<div class="codeline">continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">end if.</div>
</div>

<p>This example is organized using Inform’s semicolon syntax, which
allows indents using Tabs, but doesn’t require them. (For more on this
syntax, see the section on “Indenting,” later in this chapter.) Note
that if we’re using the semicolon syntax, there is <em>no</em> comma
after “if the bowl is shattered”, and we have to back out of any “if”
test by saying “end if” when we’re done with it. In code that makes
several if-tests, a block formatted this way may end with several “end
if” statements in a row.</p>

<p>If we’re using the semicolon syntax, as shown immediately above,
Inform not only doesn’t care about indents, it doesn’t care whether we
include carriage returns at all. We could just as easily write it this
way (though it’s much harder for humans to read):</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking the ceramic bowl: if the bowl is shattered begin;\nsay &quot;What would be the point?&quot;; otherwise; continue the action; end\nif.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking the ceramic bowl: if the bowl is shattered begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "What would be the point?"; otherwise; continue the action; end</div>
<div class="codeline">if.</div>
</div>

<p>Of the four examples above, I prefer always to use the format in the
second one. When I use a consistent format, it’s easier for me to spot
mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="assertions">Assertions</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href="../WI_2.html#section1">WI 2.1: Creating the world</a>, an <em>assertion</em> is a statement
about something &ndash; usually about something in the model world you’re
creating. A lot of your writing in Inform will consist of assertions.
Here are some assertions:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A saucer is on the table. The saucer is a supporter. A teacup is on\nthe saucer.\n\nNorth of the Sandy Beach is the Rocky Cove.\n\nDavid is a man in the Living Room. David wears a leather vest and\ncarries a walking stick.\n\nEye-color is a kind of value. A person has an eye-color. The\neye-colors are blue, brown, and green.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A saucer is on the table. The saucer is a supporter. A teacup is on</div>
<div class="codeline">the saucer.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">North of the Sandy Beach is the Rocky Cove.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">David is a man in the Living Room. David wears a leather vest and</div>
<div class="codeline">carries a walking stick.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Eye-color is a kind of value. A person has an eye-color. The</div>
<div class="codeline">eye-colors are blue, brown, and green.</div>
</div>

<p>The phrase “a kind of value” has a special meaning to Inform. We’ll
discuss that in the section “Values,” below. The reason to include it
here is so you’ll see that some assertions are a little more abstract
than others &ndash; they may be about forms of computer data that Inform will
need to know, rather than about physical objects in the model world.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice about assertions is that each assertion is
a complete sentence. You don’t actually have to begin your sentences
with capital letters &ndash; Inform doesn’t care about this. But it’s a good
idea to get in the habit of writing Inform code so that it looks more or
less like normal written English. (If you’re in the habit of texting in
lower-case, using capitals may seem weird, but most forms of published
writing require capitals.) An assertion can end either with a period or
with a blank line of white space.</p>

<p>The second thing to notice is that the verbs in assertions are in
present tense. (“Tense” is a term that refers to whether the action in
the sentence takes place in the past, present, or future.) We can’t do
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`David was a man in the Living Room. David wore a leather vest and\ncarried a walking stick. [Errors!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">David was a man in the Living Room. David wore a leather vest and</div>
<div class="codeline">carried a walking stick. [Errors!]</div>
</div>

<p>Those verbs are in past tense, and Inform won’t understand them. Your
printed output can be in the past tense if you like, but that requires a
bit of extra programming; for details, see <a
href="#story-tense-and-viewpoint">Story Tense and Viewpoint</a>.</p>

<p>The third thing to notice is that when we’re writing assertions about
physical objects, it’s a very good idea to start the sentence with “A,”
“An,” or “The” in the normal way. (These words are called
<em>articles.</em>) With some types of phrases, Inform won’t care
whether you use articles or not. But when you’re first creating an
object, Inform will notice whether you use an article. It will also
notice whether you begin the name of the object with a capital
letter.</p>

<p>Here are three assertions that are very similar except for their use
of articles and capital letters:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The spoon is on the table.\n\nKnife is on the table.\n\nA Plate is on the table.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The spoon is on the table.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Knife is on the table.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A Plate is on the table.</div>
</div>

<p>If we include these assertions in our game (after adding a table to
the game, obviously), Inform will assume that Knife should always be
capitalized and should never be given an article. That is, it will think
Knife is a proper noun. It will assume that Plate should also be
capitalized, but that an article should be used &ndash; because that’s what
the assertions did. When the game gets around to constructing a list of
the items on the table (Inform will do this automatically in certain
situations), the game will print out the list like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p>On the table are a spoon, Knife, and a Plate.</p>
</div>

<p>This is ugly. But far from being a defect in Inform, this behavior is
a strong point. If you read <a href="../WI_3.html#section18">WI 3.18: Articles and proper names</a>, you’ll see how easy it is to
create objects whose names will be printed out in various sensible ways.
The moral of the story is simple: Inform 7 can do almost anything that
you might want it to do &ndash; but it’s up to you to think carefully about
what you want it to do, and then use the correct syntax when writing
your code.</p>

<h3 id="values">Values</h3>

<p>Values in Inform are pretty much like what other computer programming
languages call <em>variables</em>. <span id="Ref_variable"
class="anchor"></span>And in fact, when we create a value we can either
call it a variable, or say that it varies:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`X is a number variable.\n\nY is a number that varies.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">X is a number variable.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Y is a number that varies.</div>
</div>

<p>But as <a href="../WI_4.html#section8">WI 4.8: New value properties</a> and the
following sections of Chapter 4 show, many of the values
authors use in Inform programming are not numbers but words or even
blocks of text:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`X is a text variable. X is &quot;Ugh.&quot;\n\nY is a text that varies. Y is &quot;Wow!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">X is a text variable. X is "Ugh."</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Y is a text that varies. Y is "Wow!"</div>
</div>

<p>After creating the values above (X and Y), we can <em>initialize</em>
them if we like by telling Inform what to store in the value at the
start of the game. The statements “X is “Ugh.”” and “Y is “Wow!”” should
be read as starting with an invisible “When play begins:”. They’re not
permanent assignments &ndash; the data stored in X and Y can change during the
game. What we can’t do is change the <em>kind</em> of data stored in the
value. Elsewhere in our code, we could say “now X is “Okay, I
guess&hellip;”.”, but we couldn’t say “now X is 17”, because that would
attempt to turn X from a text into a number.</p>

<p>What’s extremely interesting and useful for game design is that
Inform’s word values can have properties. If you look at <a href="../WI_4.html#section9">WI
4.9</a>, you’ll see these two statements:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Brightness is a kind of value. The brightnesses are guttering, weak,\nradiant, and blazing.\n\nA brightness can be adequate or inadequate. A brightness is usually\nadequate. Guttering is inadequate.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Brightness is a kind of value. The brightnesses are guttering, weak,</div>
<div class="codeline">radiant, and blazing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A brightness can be adequate or inadequate. A brightness is usually</div>
<div class="codeline">adequate. Guttering is inadequate.</div>
</div>

<p>Why would you want to do this? Because now you can test whether the
brightness of a thing is adequate:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A lamp is a kind of thing. A lamp has a brightness. The brightness of\na lamp is usually radiant. The table lamp is a lamp.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A lamp is a kind of thing. A lamp has a brightness. The brightness of</div>
<div class="codeline">a lamp is usually radiant. The table lamp is a lamp.</div>
</div>

<p>Now we can write a test such as, “if the brightness of the table lamp
is adequate”.</p>

<p>Values that are lists of words can be changed explicitly (“now the
brightness of the table lamp is weak;”), but you may occasionally want
to change the value without knowing beforehand what it is &ndash; for example,
if the player needs to set a furnace or a loudspeaker to a higher or
lower level. When we do this, we have to be careful. First the syntax,
then the explanation:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the brightness of the table lamp is the brightness after the\nbrightness of the table lamp;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the brightness of the table lamp is the brightness after the</div>
<div class="codeline">brightness of the table lamp;</div>
</div>

<p>The reason this can be problematical is because Inform assumes that
the named values are arranged in a circle. The brightness after radiant
is blazing (which is fine), but the brightness after blazing is
guttering. As a result, the player who turns up the lamp repeatedly may
find that it suddenly stops producing light. This is not very desirable.
To squash this kind of bug, we need to take a different approach.
Continuing to work with the brightness of the table lamp, we might do
something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To promote the brightness of (X - a thing):\n\tif the brightness of X is not blazing:\n\t\tnow the brightness of X is the brightness after the brightness of X.\n\nTo demote the brightness of (X - a thing):\n\tif the brightness of X is not guttering:\n\t\tnow the brightness of X is the brightness before the brightness of X.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To promote the brightness of (X - a thing):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the brightness of X is not blazing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the brightness of X is the brightness after the brightness of X.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To demote the brightness of (X - a thing):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the brightness of X is not guttering:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the brightness of X is the brightness before the brightness of X.</div>
</div>

<p>Now we can safely boost the lamp’s brightness in our code by writing,
“promote the brightness of the table lamp.” For more about this syntax,
see <a href="../WI_11.html#section18">WI 11.18: the value after and the value before</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to variable values, Inform includes what programmers call
<em>boolean</em> values. A boolean variable can have only one of two
possible values: It’s either true or false. Inform calls this type of
variable a <strong>truth state</strong><span id="Ref_truth_state"
class="anchor"></span>. Often it’s easier to use named value properties
rather than truth states, but sometimes a truth state will do the job
more succinctly. Here are two ways to accomplish pretty much the same
thing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The ceramic bowl can be broken or unbroken. The ceramic bowl is\nunbroken.\n\nThe ceramic bowl has a truth state called brokenness. The brokenness\nof the ceramic bowl is false.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The ceramic bowl can be broken or unbroken. The ceramic bowl is</div>
<div class="codeline">unbroken.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The ceramic bowl has a truth state called brokenness. The brokenness</div>
<div class="codeline">of the ceramic bowl is false.</div>
</div>

<p>If we do it the first way, we can later test “if the ceramic bowl is
broken”. If we do it the second way, we need to test “if the brokenness
of the ceramic bowl is true”. That’s a slightly more cumbersome way to
phrase the code.</p>

<p>In some programming languages, you could write, “if the brokenness of
the ceramic bowl:”, and the language would understand that because
brokenness has to be true or false, this if-test is sensible, and should
be evaluated as either true or false. But Inform won’t do this. We have
to write, “if the brokenness of the ceramic bowl is true:”.</p>

<p>More information on values is found in <a href="../WI_8.html#section1">WI 8.1: Change of values that vary</a> and
<a href="../WI_8.html#section4">WI 8.4: Change of
either/or properties”</a>.</p>

<p>When you create a value and attach it to an object as a property of
that object, you should always tell Inform what value to give the
property at the start of the game. This is called <em>initializing</em>
the value:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The drill bit is a thing. The drill bit has a number called length.\nThe length of the drill bit is 6.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The drill bit is a thing. The drill bit has a number called length.</div>
<div class="codeline">The length of the drill bit is 6.</div>
</div>

<p>(If you want to have the length be in inches, centimeters, or some
other unit of measurement rather than just a number, consult <a href="../WI_15.html#section_8">WI 15.8 Units</a>. You don’t
actually have to initialize the value of a number, but if you don’t,
your game may not work the way you expect it to.</p>

<p>If you’re creating a kind of object &ndash; something that you’ll have
several of in your game &ndash; you can give every instance of the kind the
same property. Again, initializing the value is a good idea:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A drill bit is a kind of thing. A drill bit has a number called\nlength. The length of a drill bit is 6.\n\nThe iron bit is a drill bit. The length of the iron bit is 4.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A drill bit is a kind of thing. A drill bit has a number called</div>
<div class="codeline">length. The length of a drill bit is 6.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The iron bit is a drill bit. The length of the iron bit is 4.</div>
</div>

<p>Another way to do this is to create a kind of value and then give the
object that kind of value:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Hardness is a kind of value. The hardnesses are hard and soft.\n\nA drill bit is a kind of thing. A drill bit has a hardness. The\nhardness of a drill bit is hard.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Hardness is a kind of value. The hardnesses are hard and soft.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A drill bit is a kind of thing. A drill bit has a hardness. The</div>
<div class="codeline">hardness of a drill bit is hard.</div>
</div>

<p>This doesn’t prevent you from creating some particular drill bit with
a hardness of soft; all the code above is really saying is that the
hardness of a drill bit is <em>usually</em> hard (unless you happen to
write something that changes it). Experienced Inform programmers use the
word “usually” in this situation:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The hardness of a drill bit is usually hard.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The hardness of a drill bit is usually hard.</div>
</div>

<p>You can say “The hardness of a drill bit is always hard.” The word
“always” produces a constant value, one that can’t be changed elsewhere
in your code.</p>

<p>Temporary, local values can be created within code blocks. If you’re
new to programming, you may not realize that these temporary values have
meaning <em>only</em> within the code block where they’re defined. Once
that block finishes, the value is thrown away. For instance, here’s some
code borrowed from Chapter 5 of this book:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After reading a command:\n\tlet T be text;\n\tlet T be the player&apos;s command;\n\t[... and so on ...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be text;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let T be the player's command;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip; and so on &hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>The word “let” is used to create a temporary value (that is, a
variable). Here, we’ve created a temporary value called T. In this
situation, we don’t need to tell Inform that T is a value that varies;
Inform understands that it will probably need to vary while the After
rule is running. What you need to know is that T can’t be referred to
anywhere else in your code. It exists only within this After rule. In
fact, you can write many different rules that have values with the same
name, such as “X” or “the nearby room”. This doesn’t produce a bug.</p>

<p>Within the code block, you can manipulate the temporary value in
whatever way you might like &ndash; but your manipulations will have an effect
on the rest of the model world only if you write some code that causes
them to. If you need to store a temporary value that you’ve created
within a code block in order to be able to use it later on in some other
part of the program, you can do so by creating a permanent variable as a
storage space:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The drill bit has a number called length. The length of the drill bit is 4.\nInstead of drilling the hole:\n\tlet L be a number;\n\tlet L be the length of the drill bit;\n\t[...some other code here changes the temporary value L...]\n\tnow the length of the drill bit is L.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The drill bit has a number called length. The length of the drill bit is 4.</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of drilling the hole:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be a number;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be the length of the drill bit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;some other code here changes the temporary value L&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the length of the drill bit is L.</div>
</div>

<p>Here’s an example of what can happen if you forget that a “let” value
in a code block is temporary. The person who posted the question in the
rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup wanted to figure out how much money the
player had in her wallet; and if there was enough money, to pay out some
of it. Can you spot the bug in this code?</p>

<p>The output is this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>bribe inspector</div>

<p>After bribing the inspector, you have 20 dollars remaining.</p>
</div>

<p>We’re told the inspector has been bribed to the tune of $10, but no
money has actually left the wallet. The problem is that the code only
manipulates the value of d, which is a temporary local variable. It
never actually removes the dollar bill objects from the wallet. But in
fact the problems with this code run a bit deeper. What if the player
character has $20 available, but has already removed $12 from the wallet
and is holding them in his or her hand, leaving only $8 in the wallet?
In that case, the Instead rule will fail when it ought to succeed. And
what if the player has $7 in hand and $8 in the wallet? We still need to
extract $10, but we don’t initially know where the bills are
located.</p>

<p>We need to revise the Instead rule rather extensively. <span
id="Ref_dollar_bill" class="anchor"></span>Using a little literary
license just for fun, we might come up with the code below, which works
as desired. Note that the actual handling of the dollar bills is done in
repeat loops. See <a href="#loops">Loops</a> for more.</p>

<h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3>

<p>Traditionally, computer programming languages are well supplied with
slick features for doing advanced mathematical calculations. Such
calculations are very seldom needed in interactive fiction. Nonetheless,
Inform has a surprising amount of power in this area, including the
ability to use real numbers in scientific notation, to derive square
roots, to utilize trigonometric functions such as sine and tangent, and
so on. These features are explained in <a href="../WI_15.html">Chapter 15 of <em>Writing with
Inform</em></a>.</p>

<p>Most stories will only need to keep track of a few simple integers,
for the purpose of counting things. The tool for this is the number
variable.</p>

<p>When we need to create and use a number variable (also known as “a
number that varies”), we can do it globally, or we can attach it to an
object as a property of that object. It’s pretty much up to you to
choose which form you prefer. The first way (making it a global value)
leads to easier typing, but programmers who have some experience in
object-oriented languages sometimes prefer, as a matter of style, to
attach data to objects. If you have several objects (such as a room full
of clocks) that use similar number variables, attaching the variables to
the objects as properties would definitely be the way to go. Here’s how
to create a number using each of those methods:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`increase parrot-squawk-count by 1; [if it’s a global value]\n\nincrease the squawk-count of the parrot by 1; [if the number is a property of the object]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">increase parrot-squawk-count by 1; [if it’s a global value]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">increase the squawk-count of the parrot by 1; [if the number is a property of the object]</div>
</div>

<p>(A note for experienced programmers: All of the properties of an
Inform object are public. That is, they’re available to any other code
in the game. It’s not possible to make a property private: Inform does
not support data hiding. So the distinction between global variables and
properties is purely one of personal style. There is no functional
difference.)</p>

<p>We can test the current value of a variable like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the squawk-count of the parrot is greater than 7:\n\tnow the parrot is dead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot is greater than 7:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the parrot is dead.</div>
</div>

<p>The syntax for these operations is outlined in <a href="../WI_15.html#section_5">WI 15.5 Arithmetic</a>. Other tests
that we can use include:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the squawk-count of the parrot is 7: [...]\nif the squawk-count of the parrot is at least 7: [...]\nif the squawk-count of the parrot is less than 7: [...]\nif the squawk-count of the parrot is at most 7: [...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot is 7: [&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot is at least 7: [&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot is less than 7: [&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot is at most 7: [&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>Rather than write out words like “is at least,” we can for the most
part use the familiar mathematical symbols. However, Inform doesn’t
allow the use of = or == (the double equals sign) to test for equality.
Testing for equality must use “is”. The latter three of the four tests
above could be written as:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the squawk-count of the parrot &lt;= 7: [...]\nif the squawk-count of the parrot &lt; 7: [...]\nif the squawk-count of the parrot &lt;= 7: [...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot &lt;= 7: [&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot &lt; 7: [&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">if the squawk-count of the parrot &lt;= 7: [&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you’re compiling to .z5, .z6, or .z8,
the largest numbers Inform can handle are a little over 30,000 (which
should be plenty for counting parrot-squawks). If you need to use larger
numbers, you’ll have to compile your game to Glulx.</p>

<h3 id="doing-calculations">Doing Calculations</h3>

<p>In a role-playing game (RPG), you may want to keep track of various
characters’ strength and other characteristics. While the game is
running, you may need to calculate things like their combat readiness
based on various factors. The example below shows how this type of thing
might be done. It uses Inform’s To Decide syntax to run

</div>

<p>Several things about this example are worth study. In the “Instead of
jumping” rule, for instance, we have “char-roll the player.” This calls
the block of code just before it, “To char-roll (p – a person)”. This is
Inform’s standard way of creating new functions. Once the “To char-roll”
code is created, we could char-roll any character in the game. But the
compiler won’t let us char-roll anything other than a person. The
char-roll code needs to be sent a person object, because only persons
have strength, luck, and dexterity.</p>

<p>In the odd-looking syntax, “now the strength of p is a 3 d 6 roll”,
the dice-rolling routine rolls 3 dice that are 6-sided, adding the
results to give a value somewhere between 3 and 18. This value is
computed in the “To decide what number is a … roll” code block.</p>

<h3 id="testing-conditions">Testing Conditions</h3>

<p>Many of the examples in this book test conditions in the model world
and produce a different result depending on the conditions. The keyword
  in each case is “if”. <a href="../WI_11.html#section_6">WI 11.6: If</a> explains how to create and test conditions. The point
of testing a condition is for the game to make a decision about what to
do next. If the condition is true, we want the game to do one thing; if
the condition isn’t true, we want something different to happen. Here’s
a simple example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the sea is boiling hot:\n\tsay &quot;Look! Pigs with wings!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the sea is boiling hot:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Look! Pigs with wings!"</div>
</div>

<p>Two or more if-tests can be strung together in one line, like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the cat is on the couch and the catnip is on the couch and the dog is not on the couch:\n\tsay &quot;The cat goes a little crazy.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the cat is on the couch and the catnip is on the couch and the dog is not on the couch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The cat goes a little crazy."</div>
</div>

<p>But in this type of construction, Inform insists that each phrase in
the if-test be spelled out in full. The condition shown below makes
perfect sense to a human reader, but the syntax is too complicated for
Inform to understand:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the cat and the catnip are on the couch: [Error!]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the cat and the catnip are on the couch: [Error!]</div>
</div>
<h3 id="creating-new-phrases">Creating New Phrases</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may need to have your game do several things at once. A
good way to take care of this is to write what other programming
languages would call a <em>function</em>. This feature of Inform is
introduced in <a href="../WI_11.html#section2">WI 11.2</a> and <a href="../WI_11.html#section3">WI 11.3</a>. Writing a function in Inform is easy &ndash; just use the word
“To”, like this:</p>


<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To sound the alarm:\n\tnow the alarm horn is blasting;\n\tnow the burglar is frightened;\n\tnow the guard dog is awake;\n\t[...and so on...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To sound the alarm:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the alarm horn is blasting;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the burglar is frightened;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the guard dog is awake;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;and so on&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>From anywhere else in your code, you can now sound the alarm, simply
by telling Inform that that’s what you want to do:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the burglar carries the jewels:\n\tsound the alarm.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the burglar carries the jewels:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sound the alarm.</div>
</div>

<p>The main reason to write a function of this sort would be if your
game may need to sound the alarm from several different places in the
code, in response to several different events. Rather than putting the
“sound the alarm” code in several places, you can put it in just one
place. This way, if you need to edit it later, you only need to make the
change in one place, which is easier and also reduces the chance of
introducing a bug into your game.</p>

<p>If you need to, you can write a function that can be applied to any
number of different objects in your game. Here’s a slightly artificial
example that shows the syntax:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To blast open (box - a container):\n\tnow the box is open;\n\tnow the box is not openable;\n\tnow the box is damaged;\n\tsay “Boom! You blast open [the box].”\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To blast open (box - a container):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the box is open;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the box is not openable;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the box is damaged;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say “Boom! You blast open [the box].”</div>
</div>

<p>The word “box” in this example is a temporary name for some data (in
this case, an object that is a container) that is sent to the “To blast
open” phrase. In order to run this block of code, you would have to tell
Inform what “box” will refer to. If your game includes an old trunk and
a safe, for instance, you could write a line saying “blast open the old
trunk” or “blast open the safe” in your code. When Inform calls the “To
blast open” function in response to a line that reads “blast open the
old trunk,” it will know that the old trunk is now the “box” being
referred to, so it will operate exactly as if you had written “now the
old trunk is open”, “now the old trunk is not openable”, and so on. At
the end, the game will report, “Boom! You blast open the old trunk.”</p>

<p>But if you mistakenly try to blast open something that isn’t a
container, you’ll have a bug. It’s also important to note that the code
above changes the property called “damaged” on the container. If you
forget to create the property “damaged” for all of the containers in
your game, the code above may cause a run-time error.</p>

<p>Take another look at the syntax in the code above. To write a
function that takes an argument (or two arguments, if you need to), you
use parentheses, create a temporary name for the argument (“box”), then
use a single hyphen with spaces around it, then tell Inform what kind of
argument you’re planning to send to the function.</p>

<h3 id="indenting">Indenting</h3>

<p>Computer programmers (including Inform authors) often need to write
blocks of code that will be run, line by line, in a certain order. Such
blocks often need to branch based on whether a logical test is true or
false. The keyword “if” is used in many programming languages, including
Inform, to write a statement that will allow the code to branch. In
pseudo-code, a short version look be something like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`    if A, do X;\notherwise, do Y. [ pseudo-code; not valid ]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if A, do X; <br>
    otherwise, do Y. [ pseudo-code; not valid ]</div>
</div>

<p>Here, “X” and “Y” would be entire lines or multiple lines of code. A
more complex (and more realistic) example might look more like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if A, do Q, R, and S;\notherwise, do X, Y, and Z. [ pseudo-code; not valid ]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if A, do Q, R, and S;<br>otherwise, do X, Y, and Z. [ pseudo-code; not valid ]</div>
</div>

<p>Again, “Q,” “R,” “S,” and so on would be entire lines of code. In
this situation, the compiler needs some way to understand which lines of
code to group together into a block. Q, R, and S should be grouped
together, and X, Y, and Z should be grouped together &ndash; but it would be
horribly wrong to have all six grouped together!</p>

<p>Two systems for organizing lines of code into blocks (groups of
lines) are in common use. Some languages use indenting. Other languages
don’t require indenting (though indenting can be used to make their
source code easier to read). Languages that don’t use indenting usually
put brackets or curly braces (like these {&hellip;} ) around blocks of
code.</p>

<p>The original release of Inform 7 used neither system. Instead, in
keeping with the “natural language” idea, the keywords “begin” and “end”
were used to set off code blocks. Here is an example (borrowed from
Chapter 4 of this <em>Handbook</em>) using the syntax format that Inform
originally provided:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before taking the apple:\nif the player does not carry the apple begin;\nif the player carries the basket begin;\nif the apple is not in the basket begin;\nnow the apple is in the basket;\nsay &quot;You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.&quot;;\nrule succeeds;\nend if;\nend if;\nend if.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before taking the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">if the player does not carry the apple begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">if the player carries the basket begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">if the apple is not in the basket begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">now the apple is in the basket;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.";</div>
<div class="codeline">rule succeeds;</div>
<div class="codeline">end if;</div>
<div class="codeline">end if;</div>
<div class="codeline">end if.</div>
</div>

<p>This type of syntax can still be used in Inform, as noted briefly on
<a href="../WI_11.html#section7">WI 11.7: Begin and
end</a>. And in fact, when you get error messages from the compiler you may
still find a reference to “begin;”, even though you didn’t use
“begin;”.</p><!-- TODO: check -->

<p>As you can see, the internal logic of a block of code that ends with
a string of “end if” lines can be hard for a human reader to follow. You
can use indentation to make the code easier to read without changing the
syntax in any way. Here is the same code with added white space (a big
improvement).</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before taking the apple:\n\tif the player does not carry the apple\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif the player carries the basket\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tif the apple is not in the basket\n\t\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tnow the apple is in the basket;\n\t\t\tsay &quot;You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.&quot;;\n\t\t\trule succeeds;\n\t\t\tend if;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend if.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before taking the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the apple</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player carries the basket</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the apple is not in the basket</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;begin;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the apple is in the basket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end if;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end if;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end if.</div>
</div>

<p>That white space might be either Tab keys or rows of spaces &ndash; it
doesn’t matter, because the indenting is just to make the code easier
for you to read. The compiler ignores it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we’re going to use indentation to make the code
easier to read, why not dispense with the “begin/end” keywords entirely?
After Inform 7’s initial release, there was apparently a groundswell of
support for the idea of letting Inform authors use indentation
<em>instead</em> of “begin;” and “end if;”. This style of code
formatting is sometimes referred to as Pythonesque, because it’s used in
the popular Python programming language. Below is exactly the same code
as in the example above, rewritten to use colons in place of “begin;”,
and indenting to keep track of where each if block ends. Many Inform
programmers today seem to prefer this method:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before taking the apple:\n\tif the player does not carry the apple:\n\t\tif the player carries the basket:\n\t\t\tif the apple is not in the basket:\n\t\t\t\tnow the apple is in the basket;\n\t\t\t\tsay &quot;You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.&quot;;\n\t\t\t\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before taking the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the apple:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player carries the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the apple is not in the basket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the apple is in the basket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You pick up the apple and put it in the basket.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>The “end if” statements are no longer needed, but the indentation
must be used as shown, and it must use Tab characters, not series of
spaces. I find this much easier to read.</p>

<p>I’ve found that newcomers to Inform authoring quite often don’t pay
enough attention to how many indents (that is, how many Tab key presses)
they need for a particular line of code. If the indenting is wrong, the
compiler will get confused. To make matters worse, some email programs
turn indents into strings of space characters. They look the same on the
screen, but Inform requires Tabs, not spaces. So emailed code can get
messed up, even if you’ve used standard copy-and-paste to paste the code
into the email.</p>

<p>The source code editor in the Inform IDE (the authoring program)
formats each long paragraph with “hanging indents.” That is, each line
of a paragraph after the first one is indented slightly. This is purely
to make the code easier to read. The hanging indents have nothing to do
with indenting code blocks to create organization, as shown above.
They’re purely a way of making the code a bit easier to read on the
screen. (Multi-line paragraphs in this Handbook don’t have hanging
indents, so they won’t look exactly the way they will look in the
IDE.)</p>

<p>When do you indent? The rule is simple: <u>After a colon, you indent
by one more Tab than the line that ends with the colon</u>.</p>

<p>Basically, a colon means “do the following action(s).” Following
every colon is a list of one or more steps that you want Inform to take.
We can call this list of steps a <em>block</em> of source code. The
block of code should be indented by one more level (that is, one more
Tab key) than the statement before it &ndash; the if-statement that had a
colon at the end. Everything that is indented further than the line that
ends with the colon is part of that block of code, so it will run if the
if-statement (or some other colon-ended line, such as “Every turn:”)
tells it to. When we return to the same level of indentation as the line
that ended with the colon, we’re done with that inner block of code and
ready to proceed with the next statement in the outer block.</p>

<p>Yes, that description is hard to read. This diagram
may help make the organization of code into outer and inner blocks
easier to visualize. Each line in each of the colored blocks in that
diagram is indented one Tab further than the lines in the block outside
  of it.</p>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/if_blocks.png"></div>

<p>Here’s an example from a recent game of my own that may make this
idea a little more real-world. If you don’t understand what’s going on
here, you might want to look back at the section “Testing Conditions.”
In that section, if statements are explained.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of closing the eyes:\n\tif Elliott wears the black blindfold:\n\t\tsay &quot;Closing your eyes will make no difference. You&apos;re wearing a blindfold.&quot;;\n\totherwise if the location is a crystal room:\n\t\tsay &quot;You close your eyes for a moment against the dazzle of sunlight on crystal, but a moment later you bump into something and your eyes fly open again.&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tsay &quot;You close your eyes for a moment. Ah, how restful!&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of closing the eyes:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Elliott wears the black blindfold:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Closing your eyes will make no difference. You're wearing a blindfold.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if the location is a crystal room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You close your eyes for a moment against the dazzle of sunlight on crystal, but a moment later you bump into something and your eyes fly open again.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You close your eyes for a moment. Ah, how restful!"</div>
</div>

<p>This Instead rule will run when the player types CLOSE EYES. The
outer block of code in the rule begins with the colon at the end of the
first line. There are three lines in the outer block of code. The first
line begins “if Elliott wears&hellip;”, the second begins “otherwise if the
location&hellip;”, and the third is “otherwise:”. These lines are indented
with one Tab. After “if Elliott wears the black blindfold:”, we need to
indent by two Tabs to create an inner block of code. This happens to
have only one line in it, a say statement &ndash; but it could have many more
lines.</p>

<p>Note that the statement that begins “say “You close your eyes for a
moment&hellip;” is only a single line as far as Inform is concerned. It
happens to flow down onto the next line, but the fact that the next line
isn’t indented doesn’t matter, because there’s no <em>carriage
return</em> character before it. In the IDE, long lines like this have
what’s called a “hanging indent,” which makes it easy to see that
they’re all part of a single code statement.</p>

<p>Nothing in the Instead rule shown above actually changes the model
world; all it does is print out one of three different messages, all of
which are more or less equivalent to saying, “You can try that, but it
won’t do any good.” But if the rule also included a line like “now the
blindfold is transparent;” the organization of the code into outer and
inner blocks would be the same.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="too-many-indents">Too Many Indents</h4>

<p>If you’re writing an extremely complex, embedded set of if-tests,
it’s easy to lose track of where you are in the logical structure. In
this case, you’ll probably want to reorganize your code in some other
way, so as to make it easier to read and debug.</p>

<p>There are several ways to reduce the number of indentation levels.
For instance, these two Instead rules are functionally identical, but
one uses two indent levels, while the other uses only one:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of eating the pretzel:\n\tif the pretzel is salty:\n\t\tsay &quot;Recognizing that the salt is the best part, you pause and lick off the salt first.&quot;;\n\t\tnow the pretzel is not salty;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n\nInstead of eating a salty pretzel:\n\tsay &quot;Recognizing that the salt is the best part, you pause and lick off the salt first.&quot;;\n\tnow the pretzel is not salty.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of eating the pretzel:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the pretzel is salty:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Recognizing that the salt is the best part, you pause and lick off the salt first.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the pretzel is not salty;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of eating a salty pretzel:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Recognizing that the salt is the best part, you pause and lick off the salt first.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the pretzel is not salty.</div>
</div>

<p>If you need to perform a number of operations (such as changing
various values) within a block of code, you can reduce the indentation
by using a To statement. Here’s a quick example that expands slightly on
a few lines that appeared earlier in the Handbook<em>:</em></p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After attacking the ceramic bowl:\n\tif the guard is in the location:\n\t\tif the guard is awake:\n\t\t\tsound the alarm;\n\t\totherwise:\n\t\t\t[more code goes here...]\n\nTo sound the alarm:\n\tif the ceramic bowl is shattered:\n\t\t[more code goes here...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After attacking the ceramic bowl:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the guard is in the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the guard is awake:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sound the alarm;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[more code goes here&hellip;]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To sound the alarm:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the ceramic bowl is shattered:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[more code goes here&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>The line “if the ceramic bowl is shattered” has only one indent,
because it’s in a separate block of code. If it were embedded after “if
the guard is awake” in the “After attacking the guard” rule, it would
have three indents.</p>

<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>

<p>Another difference between Inform and traditional programming
languages is that, with some important exceptions, Inform doesn’t care
where you place rules and assertions. If you want to mix up your source
code, leaving related bits strewn out all over everywhere, Inform will
let you. If you’re working on the section of the story that has to do
with the swords, and you suddenly realize that you need to make sure the
men in the tower are wearing chain mail, you can just hit a couple of
Returns to start a new paragraph and create the chain mail on the spot.
There’s no need to go find the men in the tower (they could be five
hundred lines earlier or later in the file) and put the chain mail in
their part of the code.</p>

<p>This is bad programming practice, though. It’s much better to keep
related code together. Inform’s Index World tab will help you find
everything in your code, no matter where it is. But if you create your
own organization, the writing will go more smoothly, and you’ll end up
with fewer bugs.</p>

<p>The natural and normal way to do this is by writing headings, as
explained in <a href="../WI_2.html#section5">WI 2.5</a>,
and putting all of the code for some specific thing below a single
heading. For instance, the chapter on the wizard might include a section
called “Conversations with the Wizard.”</p>

<p>The larger your game is, the more important it will become to use
headings in this manner. In most programming languages, you can put
various parts of the code in separate files on your hard drive. Inform
doesn’t allow this, because it’s designed around the idea that what
you’re writing is a story or book, which would naturally be one
continuous block of text.</p>

<p>Using headings within a single file is almost as convenient as
organizing your program in multiple files, and it has some advantages
too. After you’ve compiled your game, the Index Contents tab will
display an outline of the source code, listing all of the headings.
There’s also a Contents tab in the Source pane. This makes it easy to
move around in a large file &ndash; just click on the heading, and the Source
pane will jump to it. (If you’ve added code since the last time you
compiled, this mechanism may not work perfectly. Click the Go! button
and then look at the Contents page of the Index again.)</p>

<p>How you organize the code and give headings to the various sections
is almost entirely up to you. The only requirement is that each heading
be on a line by itself, with a blank line before it and another blank
line after it.</p>

<p>Inform recognizes five words as headings: volume, book, part,
chapter, and section. When the Index is being constructed, these five
headings are considered <em>hierarchical</em>, which is just a fancy way
of saying that a volume is bigger than a book, a book is bigger than a
part, and so on. But you can ignore the hierarchy if you like, and give
sections headings in whatever order you like. A well organized outline
might look like this:</p>


<ul>Volume 1 – The Castle
  <li>Book 1 – The Courtyard</li>
  <ul>
<li>Part 1 – The Courtyard Room Itself</li>
<li>Part 2 – Scenery in the Courtyard</li>
<li>Part 3 – The Guard</li>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 – The Guard Himself</li>
<li>Chapter 2 – Conversations with the Guard</li>
<li>Chapter 3 – Being Chased by the Guard</li>
</ul></ul>
<li>Book 2 – The Dining Hall</li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;and so on.</p>

<p>Many Inform programmers prefer to number their volumes, books, parts,
and so on, as shown above. But the numbers don’t have to be in order,
and numbering is not even required. All that’s required is that there be
<em>something</em> after the heading word. If you just type Chapter and
then forget to put anything after it, the compiler will complain. (Also,
you can’t put a period or colon immediately after a heading word.)</p>

<p>Giving each heading a name is a very good idea. This will help you
understand what you’re seeing in the Index.</p>

<p>One of my students put a bunch of related material in a single
chapter and then asked, “How can I tell Inform, ‘Chapter 3 starts now’?”
This is a very reasonable question, but the answer is &ndash; you can’t. The
headings are strictly a way to organize your source code. They have no
effect whatever on what happens when the game is being played. To switch
to a new set of circumstances at a certain point in the game, you need
to use scenes, as explained in Chapter 8 of this <em>Handbook</em> and
<a href="../WI_10.html"><strong>Chapter 10</strong> of <em>Writing with Inform</em>,
“Scenes.”</a></p>

<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>

<p>Sometimes a computer program needs to perform a certain operation
over and over. If it needs to do the same operation 50 times, there’s no
sense in writing out the same block of code 50 times. Instead, we write
it out once and then execute it over and over until we’re done. The
process of doing this is called a loop.</p>

<p>Loops are used less in interactive fiction than in many other types
of programming, but they definitely have their uses. The basic syntax
  for how to use loops is in <a href="WI_11.html#section_9">WI 11.html.9 While</a>, <a href="WI_11.html#section_10">WI 11.10 Repeat</a>, and <a href="WI_11#section_11">WI 11.11 Repeat running through</a>. We’ve already seen loops a few times in the
<em>Handbook,</em> for instance in the <a
href="#Ref_dollar_bill">dollar bill example</a>, where the loop was used to move a bunch
of dollar bills. Here’s a more straightforward example.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose you have a set of rooms in a region called the
Underground Area, and let’s suppose the player has just thrown a circuit
breaker that plunges the entire Underground Area into darkness. In that
case, you could write a routine in which you manually list each room in
the Underground Area and make it not lit &ndash; but it would be easier, and
less likely to introduce errors, if you write a routine that
automatically loops through all of the rooms in the Underground Area and
makes them dark, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Carry out switching off the circuit breaker:\n\trepeat with R running through rooms in the Underground Area:\n\t\tnow R is not lit;\n\tcontinue the action.\n\nCarry out switching on the circuit breaker:\n\trepeat with R running through rooms in the Underground Area:\n\t\tnow R is lit;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Carry out switching off the circuit breaker:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with R running through rooms in the Underground Area:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now R is not lit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out switching on the circuit breaker:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with R running through rooms in the Underground Area:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now R is lit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<p>In these two Carry Out rules, we’re using the temporary variable R to
refer to a room. (We could just as easily have called it Freddie &ndash; the
use of R to mean “room” is not special.) The loop is created by the word
“repeat”. To execute the loop, Inform first makes a list of the rooms in
the Underground Area and then runs the code for the loop (which in this
case consists of the single line “now R is not lit”) a number of time.
Each time Inform goes through the loop, the variable R refers to a
different room. So the loop has the effect of turning off the lights in
each room in the Underground Area, one by one. When it gets to the end
of the list of rooms in the Underground Area, the loop stops.</p>

<p>Here’s a slightly more complete example that uses a while loop.
Inform provides no command with which the player can empty out a
container, so we’ll create one. We’ll also give the player a container
that can be emptied.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a basket. A spool is in the basket. A squirrel is in the basket.

</div>

<p>The loop is in the Carry Out Emptying rule. (The check rule makes
sure that the object the player wants to empty is a container, that it’s
open, and that it’s not empty already.) We first create a temporary
variable, R, and assign its value to something or other in the container
(we don’t care what). We have to do this before we enter the while loop,
so that Inform will know what R refers to. After moving R to the
location, we make R stand for something else, and then we return to the
top of the loop. As long as R is something (an object), the loop will
continue to cycle. But if the container is now empty, R has become
nothing, so the loop terminates.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-10-advanced-topics">Chapter 10: Advanced Topics</h2>

<p>To round out <em>The Inform 7 Handbook,</em> we’ll take a quick look
at some of the advanced topics that Inform authors sometimes need or
want to know about. We’re not going to provide every detail about any of
these topics &ndash; that would take a whole other book. But if you’re
wondering what may lie ahead in your adventures with Inform, this
chapter will help you get started on the right foot. For more details
about how to use the features described here, you’ll need to read the
Documentation and perhaps post messages to the intfiction.org forum
requesting help.</p>

<h3 id="story-tense-and-viewpoint">Story Tense and Viewpoint</h3>

<p>Present tense and second person viewpoint are very widely used in
interactive fiction. For instance:</p>

<p>You can see a teapot and a vicious troll here.</p>

<p>“You” is second person (English makes no distinction between second
person singular and second person plural), and “can see” is present
tense. But what if you’d like to write a story in first person singular,
past tense? Or, more exotically, third person plural, future tense? The
current version of the Inform library provides fairly full support for
writing a game in any combination of tense and viewpoint, as explained
in <a href="../WI_14.html#section_1">WI 14.1: Tense and narrative viewpoint</a>. In fact,
you can switch tense and viewpoint at any point in the story, which
might be useful if one section of the story is a flashback to an earlier
time, or has a different viewpoint character.</p>

<p>If your game is written entirely with one tense and viewpoint, the
details of how the Standard Library does this magic trick may not be of
much interest. You can just put something like this near the beginning
of your source code, and you’re good to go:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`When play begins:\n\tnow the story viewpoint is first person singular;\n\tnow the story tense is past tense.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the story viewpoint is first person singular;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the story tense is past tense.</div>
</div>

<p>This will produce output in the form:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<p>I could see a teapot and a vicious troll here.</p>
</div>

<p>If you need to switch from one viewpoint or tense to another during
the course of the game, you’ll probably want to make use of the same
kinds of text insertions that the Standard Library uses. These methods
are detailed in <a href="../WI_14.html">WI Chapter 14</a>.</p>

<h3 id="code-optimization">Code Optimization</h3>

<p>In the 1970s, when the very first interactive fiction games were
written, computers were (by today’s standards) incredibly slow, and had
almost no memory. As a result, games &ndash; and every other type of software
&ndash; had to be written very efficiently. If the software had to do a lot of
churning, the user might issue a command and then have to wait ten or
twenty seconds for the computer’s response. Or all afternoon. Issue a
command, then go out for coffee, or come back tomorrow morning to find
out if your program did what you expected it to. This was annoying, to
say the least.</p>

<p>Today’s computers are incredibly fast, and have gigantic memory
capacities. So there’s no longer any need to think about optimizing your
game code.</p>

<p>At least, that was true ten years ago, when Inform 7 was first
designed. But since then, a couple of developments in the world of
personal computing have changed the picture somewhat.</p>

<p>First, text games are now being played on hand-held devices such as
cell phones. These gadgets have less memory than a desktop Mac or PC,
and their processors are slower too. Until next-generation hand-helds
get faster and boast more memory, optimizing your game so that it will
run smoothly on this growing family of devices will be important.</p>

<p>But there’s a bigger issue. Two new interpreters, Parchment (for .z5
and .z8 games) and Quixe (for Glulx games) have been released that run
directly in Web browsers. This is a terrific development, as it opens up
the potential audience for IF to millions of people who would be
unlikely to download a separate interpreter program. Other browser-based
terps are also appearing. What they have in common is that they’re
written in a language called Javascript. You don’t need to know a
blessed thing about Javascript in order to see your games running on one
of these interpreters &ndash; but you need to understand that Javascript can
be slow. Five years from now that bottleneck may have gone away, and IF
authors will be free to write free-wheeling, inefficient games. Until
then, you may want to think about utilizing a few programming techniques
that will optimize your Inform games.</p>

<p>For the following discussion, I’m relying on information from Ron
Newcomb, Andrew Plotkin, and others. They know a lot more about Inform,
and about programming in general, than I do. (Plotkin created Quixe, in
fact.)</p>

<h4 id="instead-of-instead">Instead of Instead</h4>

<p>As noted previously regarding <a href="#ref_efficiency_box">efficiency</a>,
Inform’s mechanism for processing the player’s input by means of
rulebooks called Before, Instead, and After is inefficient. This is
because there’s only one of each of these rulebooks. On the other hand,
each action (such as EXAMINE, TAKE, and DROP) has its own Check, Carry
Out, and Report rulebooks. What this means is that each time the player
enters a command, the game will consult <em>all</em> of the Before,
Instead, and After rules that you’ve written to see if any of them
applies. In a large game, that could be hundreds of rules.</p>

<p>In many cases, you can easily replace Instead rules with Check and
Carry Out rules and After rules with Carry Out and/or Report rules.
Let’s start with a simple Check rule:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The player carries a rotten banana. The banana is edible.\n\nCheck eating the banana:\n\tsay &quot;Ewwww!&quot; instead.\n\n[Instead of eating the banana:\n\tsay &quot;Ewwww!&quot;] [This produces the same result, but it&apos;s less efficient.]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The player carries a rotten banana. The banana is edible.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check eating the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Ewwww!" instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">[Instead of eating the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Ewwww!"] [This produces the same result, but it's less efficient.]</div>
</div>

<p>The main difference between the two rules is that the Check rule has
to have the word “instead” tacked onto the end. If you forget to do this
(and it’s easy to forget), Inform will consult the Check rule and then
go on to run the Carry Out and Report rules for the action. The word
“instead” causes the rule to succeed, which is a technical way of saying
that nothing else will happen.</p>

<p>In exactly the same way, we can replace an After rule with a Report
rule, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`[After eating the banana:\n\tsay &quot;After chowing down on the banana, you feel a little ill.&quot;] [Not efficient.]\n\nReport eating the banana:\n\tsay &quot;After chowing down on the banana, you feel a little ill.&quot;;\n\trule succeeds.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">[After eating the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "After chowing down on the banana, you feel a little ill."] [Not efficient.]</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report eating the banana:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "After chowing down on the banana, you feel a little ill.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div>

<p>Again, we have to tack on a little extra syntax (“rule succeeds”) to
shut off Inform’s default Report rule for the eating action &ndash; but if
you’re concerned about efficiency, this is a small price to pay.</p>

<p>Rewriting a Before rule as a Check or Carry Out rule is trickier, if
only because Before rules are intended for situations that are a little
tricky. I tend to use Before rules mostly in constructions like
this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Before doing anything other than examining to the sky, say &quot;The sky is too far away.&quot; instead.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Before doing anything other than examining to the sky, say "The sky is too far away." instead.</div>
</div>

<p>This type of construction (“anything other than&hellip;”) can’t be used in
Check or Carry Out rules, simply because each action has its own set of
rulebooks.</p>

<h4 id="every-turn-rules-1">Every Turn Rules</h4>

<p>In every turn, every Every Turn rule in your game will be consulted
to see whether it’s relevant. As your Every Turn rules proliferate, the
game will become less efficient. Fortunately, most of your Every Turn
rules will probably be targeted at specific circumstances, such as when
a certain scene is active or when the player is in a certain room. If
you group all of the Every Turn rules that apply to a given situation as
if-tests within a single rule, you’ll gain efficiency. For instance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Every turn when in the Glue Factory:\n\tif the security guard is in the Factory:\n\t\tsay &quot;The guard belches loudly.&quot;;\n\tif Esmerelda is in the Factory:\n\t\tsay &quot;Esmerelda sighs winsomely.&quot;;\n\tif the blast furnace is heated:\n\t\tsay &quot;Heat radiates from the blast furnace.&quot;;\n\t[...and so on...]\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Every turn when in the Glue Factory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the security guard is in the Factory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "The guard belches loudly.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if Esmerelda is in the Factory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Esmerelda sighs winsomely.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the blast furnace is heated:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "Heat radiates from the blast furnace.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[&hellip;and so on&hellip;]</div>
</div>

<p>When the player is in the Glue Factory, the fact that the rules are
grouped will change nothing &ndash; but whenever the player is <em>not</em> in
the Glue Factory, only one Every Turn rule will be consulted to see
whether it applies, rather than several of them.</p>

<h4 id="other-ways-to-streamline-your-code">Other Ways to Streamline Your Code</h4>

<p>Occasionally, the “after reading a command” activity will prove very
useful. But it runs each time the player types the Return key, so
putting a lot of if-tests in it will slow the game down. I’ve run into
one or two aspiring authors who thought it would be cool to basically
reinvent the parser by putting a bunch of stuff in the “after reading a
command” activity. To do this, they tried to write lots and lots of code
to figure out whether the player’s command included specific words.
That’s the parser’s job. If you can use an offstage object, a backdrop,
or an invisible part of the player, any of which can be given vocabulary
words, to direct the parser to the result you’re trying to create, that
will be more efficient &ndash; and also friendlier to the player and less
likely to include bugs.</p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>Tables are Inform’s way of organizing complicated blocks of data.
<a href="../WI_16.html">Chapter 16 of <em>Writing with Inform</em>, “Tables”</a>,
will tell you a great deal about tables, but it won’t, at first glance,
give you a very clear idea why you might want to use a table. I’m pretty
sure you can write a complete and satisfying game without ever using
tables. They’re a specialized tool, used mainly when you have long lists
of stuff that you want to be able to organize and then get at during the
game. Tables are used in creating hint menus and conversation menus, for
instance.</p>

<p>When I asked the Inform experts for ideas about why an author might
want to use a table, Emily Short provided an excellent list. I’ll
include her suggestions here, with only minor editing, in case they
might give you an idea or two for your next game.</p>
</div>

<p>In a nutshell, here’s what you need to know about tables in order to
start using them:</p>

<p>The data in tables is organized into rows and columns. Each column
has a name, which is how you’ll refer to it while writing your game. The
table itself has a name too. The rows don’t have names; they’re
numbered. That is, they’re implicitly numbered &ndash; when you write out your
table, you don’t use numbers.</p>

<p>Each column can contain only one type of data. The first column might
contain things, for example, the second column numbers, and the third
and fourth columns text. If you try to mix up the columns, for instance
putting a number where text belongs, Inform won’t let you. An entry in
any row or column can be left blank by typing two hyphens (--).</p>

<p>When you create a table, you separate the data within each row by
using one or more Tab characters. Rows of space characters look the same
to you and me, but they won’t do the job. At the end of each column, you
hit a single Return/Enter, and then start the next column. Tables with
long texts tend to look quite jumbled on the Source page, but if you
follow these rules and ignore how the table looks on the screen, it will
work the way you want it to.</p>

<p>Let’s create a table, so that we can refer to it in the rest of this
section:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A furry menace is a kind of thing.\n\nThe gopher is a furry menace in the Meadow.\nThe muskrat is a furry menace in the Meadow.\nThe chipmunk is a furry menace in the Meadow.\nThe mole is a furry menace in the Meadow.\n\nTable of Obnoxious Mammals\ncritter\t\tname\t\tweight\ngopher\t\t&quot;Herman&quot;\t17\nmuskrat\t&quot;Vivian&quot;\t12\nchipmunk\t&quot;Abercrombie&quot;\t9\nmole\t\t&quot;Edith&quot;\t\t27\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A furry menace is a kind of thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The gopher is a furry menace in the Meadow.</div>
<div class="codeline">The muskrat is a furry menace in the Meadow.</div>
<div class="codeline">The chipmunk is a furry menace in the Meadow.</div>
<div class="codeline">The mole is a furry menace in the Meadow.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Table of Obnoxious Mammals</div>
<div class="codeline">critter&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;name&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;weight</div>
<div class="codeline">gopher&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"Herman"&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;17</div>
<div class="codeline">muskrat&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"Vivian"&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;12</div>
<div class="codeline">chipmunk&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"Abercrombie"&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;9</div>
<div class="codeline">mole&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;"Edith"&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;27</div>
</div>

<p>The first row under the table name contains the column headings
(critter, name, weight). These are just abstract words, as far as Inform
is concerned. I’d recommend not using a word that Inform is using for
something else, or that you’re using elsewhere in your own code. You
should avoid column headings like “location” and “container”, for
instance.</p>

<p>To use the data in any cell in the table, we can refer to it by the
line number and column heading. For instance, “the name in row 4 of the
Table of Obnoxious Mammals” is the text “Edith”. If you’re familiar with
computer programming, you’ll understand when I say that Inform’s table
rows are 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. In plain English, the number of the
first row is 1, not 0.</p>

<p>You can also get at the data in the table by cross-referencing the
data you want with the data in some other column, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`say &quot;The name of the muskrat in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is\n[name corresponding to the critter of muskrat in the Table of Obnoxious\nMammals].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">say "The name of the muskrat in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is</div>
<div class="codeline">[name corresponding to the critter of muskrat in the Table of Obnoxious</div>
<div class="codeline">Mammals]."</div>
</div>

<p>Note the slightly weird syntax here. We have to say “corresponding to
the critter of muskrat” &ndash; we can’t say, “corresponding to the muskrat
critter.”</p>

<p>You may sometimes need to change the data in a table during the
course of the game. Inform’s standard “now … is” syntax will do the
job:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the weight in row 1 of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is 8;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the weight in row 1 of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is 8;</div>
</div>

<p>It’s often useful to look at all of the data in a table, one row at a
time. Here’s one way to do that:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`repeat with N running from 1 to the number of rows in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals:\n\tif the weight in row N of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is greater than 15:\n\t\tsay &quot;[Name in row N of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals] is rather obese.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">repeat with N running from 1 to the number of rows in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the weight in row N of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals is greater than 15:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[Name in row N of the Table of Obnoxious Mammals] is rather obese."</div>
</div>

<p>The phrase “repeat with N running from 1 to the number of Rows in the
Table of Mammals” is explained in <a href="../WI_16.html#section_6">WI 16.6</a>. This phrase has several elements. The
phrase “repeat with” creates a <em>loop.</em> Inform will run through
the code block below the “repeat with” statement over and over. The
first time through the loop, N will be 1. The second time through the
loop, N will be 2. And so forth. N is a <em>loop counter;</em> the words
“running from 1 to” are what tells Inform that N is a number, and that
it’s a loop counter. The phrase “the number of rows in the Table of
Mammals” should be obvious; in this case it’s 4, because our silly
little table has four rows. So the loop will run four times, and then
stop.</p>

<p>While the loop is running, we can use the number N (which is
different each time Inform goes through the loop) to do various things
to the data in the table. Mainly, we can look up data in row N, or we
can change it.</p>

<p>Here’s a more concise way of doing the same thing, without using a
loop counter:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`repeat through the Table of Obnoxious Mammals:\n\tif the weight entry is greater than 15:\n\t\tsay &quot;[name entry] is rather obese.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">repeat through the Table of Obnoxious Mammals:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the weight entry is greater than 15:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[name entry] is rather obese."</div>
</div>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="../WI_16.html#section_12">WI 16.12 Listed in&hellip;</a>, when Inform looks at some data in a table
row, that row is automatically chosen. This makes it easy to refer to
the other data in the same row without having to tell the compiler what
row we’re talking about. Here’s an example that shows how this works.
Because we defined the objects that show up in the table as of the furry
menace kind, we can write a rule that will apply to any furry
menace:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of examining a furry menace (called FM):\n\tif FM is a critter listed in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals: \n\t\tsay &quot;[The FM] is named [name entry].&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of examining a furry menace (called FM):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if FM is a critter listed in the Table of Obnoxious Mammals: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The FM] is named [name entry]."</div>
</div>

<p>We don’t need to say “[name corresponding to the FM in the Table of
Obnoxious Mammals]” &ndash; in fact, we can’t say it, because Inform won’t
know what it means. Because the row has already been chosen
automatically, “[name entry]” will work fine.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may need to change the data in a table entry. You can
do this by referring to an entry in another column of that same row,
which is convenient, because it means you don’t need to know the number
of the row the data is in. Continuing with our rather silly example,
we’re going to create a new action, altering, which will do nothing
except change the entry in the name column:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Altering is an action applying to one thing. Understand &quot;alter [furry\nmenace]&quot; as altering.\n\nCarry out altering:\n\nnow the name corresponding to a critter of the noun in the Table of\nObnoxious Mammals is &quot;Judy Garland&quot;;\n\nsay &quot;Name altered.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Altering is an action applying to one thing. Understand "alter [furry</div>
<div class="codeline">menace]" as altering.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out altering:</div>
<div class="codeline">now the name corresponding to a critter of the noun in the Table of</div>
<div class="codeline">Obnoxious Mammals is "Judy Garland";</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">say "Name altered."</div>
</div>

<p>The point of this example is to show the syntax. Two of the columns
are called name and critter, so “now the name corresponding to a critter
of the noun&hellip;” will let us alter the name of any of the critters to
“Judy Garland” by typing ALTER MOLE in the game, or ALTER MUSKRAT.</p>

<div class="sidebar" id="emily-short-on-using-tables">
<h4>Emily Short on Using Tables</h4>

<p>The most common uses for me are these:</p>

<p>&ndash; To manage background-event text. This might take the form of events
that need to happen in sequence, during a scene (see “Day One”), or it
might be a set of randomized atmosphere texts to be printed under
certain conditions. I use this trick <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<p>&ndash; To store the mental equivalent of inventory. In my story
“Alabaster,” for instance, there is a long, long list of facts the
player might know, each of which has a short summary text to be printed
by THINK if the player has in fact discovered this fact. This
information is stored like this:</p>
<p>
<table>
  <thead>Table of All Known Facts</thead>
  <tbody>
<tr><td>fact</td><td>summary</td></tr>
<tr><td>snowshoes-worn</td><td>"She is wearing snow shoes."</td></tr>
<tr><td>apple-pie</td><td>"She really likes apple pie."</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>&hellip;and so on, for dozens of lines. (Actual facts changed to protect
against spoilers.)</p>

<p>&ndash; To give an NPC pert replies to being asked to do dumb things. I
find it most convenient to make a table of the different rules that
cause an action to fail, and then attach some reply text to each one.
(Example 188, “Generation X,” demonstrates this.) I could also handle
this with a series of individual “unsuccessful attempt” rules, but
because there would have to be a large number of these, I find the table
is easier to take in at a glance.</p>

<p>&ndash; To construct any kind of consultable object in which the player
needs to look things up: books, computers on which you conduct
Google-style searches, or the sort of NPC that exists chiefly to answer
questions. (Most of mine don’t, which is why I usually don’t use tables
to construct them; but I could imagine a robot librarian that would be
best implemented by a table.) Several reviewers commented favorably on
the computer database search in “Floatpoint,” and this would have been
vastly harder to set up without tables with topic columns.</p>

<p>&ndash; To store flexible schedules. Inform has various time functions that
make it possible to write an inflexible schedule (X happens at a given
time of day, no matter what), but sometimes I like to have a
free-floating schedule that could start at any time. My extension
“Transit System” is a good example of this in action: Each row contains
a number of minutes and the name of a room, which is the stop where the
bus (say) ought to arrive after the requisite delay.</p>

<p>There are also some obscure programmatic uses to them, of which the
most obvious is perhaps:</p>

<p>&ndash; As an aid in extensions, whenever I want to create a sequence of
things to which the author of the game may need to add. Because tables
can very easily be amended or added to, they make good structures for an
extension designer to use. “Complex Listing” exemplifies this: It offer
several kinds of list-building options but allows the game author to add
almost any kind of addition to the selection.</p>


<p>In practice, the things you can do with a table are not <em>that</em>
numerous. They basically boil down to:</p>

<p>To find your place in a table, you can step through the whole table
row by row. You can choose a specific row, by row number or by looking
for a specific value in one of the columns, or by selecting a blank row
with nothing in it yet.</p>

<p>Manipulating the contents of a particular row, once chosen: You can
read and use a table entry for something (for instance, to print text or
set a local variable). You can write something new in a table entry. Or
you can blank out a row of entries, eliminating them permanently.</p>

<p>You can manipulate the whole table by sorting the table to put one of
the columns in a specific order.</p>

<p>Even topic tables are just a special case of this, in that they have
a column with a special name (“topic”) and they allow the author some
shorthand for looking up rows in the table based on the player’s input &ndash;
but this is still just row-choosing stuff.</p>

<h3 id="the-skein">The Skein</h3>

<!-- TODO -->
<p>As explained in <strong>pages 1.7 and 1.8</strong> of <em>Writing
with Inform</em> (“The Skein” and “A short Skein tutorial”), the Skein
and Transcript panels are used to replay series of commands and examine
the output. All the time you’re testing your game in the Game panel,
Inform is quietly recording all of your commands and all of the output
from the game. The commands are added to the Skein.</p>

<p>At any time you can switch to the Skein and double-click on a node
(the Documentation calls them “knots”), and the game will first be
compiled and then replayed from the start up to that knot. The Skein is
like the Replay button in the top toolbar, except that it can replay
<em>any</em> playing session, not just the most recent one.</p>

<p>As you work on your game, the Skein can get pretty crowded with
branches (Inform calls them “threads”) that are no longer needed. You
can trim these out by right-clicking (Mac: Ctrl-clicking) and choosing
“Delete all below”. But you won’t be allowed to delete the currently
active thread &ndash; the one that represents the game that’s currently in
progress in the Game panel. If you want to do that, you first need to
click the Stop button in the toolbar. If you want to delete everything
in the Skein, you can use the Trim button. This will get rid of
everything except the currently active thread and any threads that you
have locked.</p>

<p>As your game gets closer to being finished, the Skein will become
quite useful. You can play the entire game manually from start to finish
&ndash; until you get to the <strong>*** You have won ***</strong> message (or
whatever message you’re using to indicate victory) &ndash; and then open the
Skein and <em>lock</em> the thread you’ve just created. Locking a thread
will stop Inform from deleting it, even if you use the Trim button. In
the Transcript panel, you can <em>bless</em> the output transcript for
this thread. Blessing tells Inform that this is the output you hope to
see in the final, released version of the game. Blessing has no actual
effect on the game itself; it’s just a record-keeping function. It
stores a transcript so that you can look at it later.</p>

<p>After making further changes in your game (to eliminate bugs, for
instance, or to add features suggested by your testers), you can run the
game again using the locked thread, as a quick check to make sure you
haven’t done anything that makes the game unwinnable. You can then
inspect the output in the Transcript to see what changes have appeared.
Using the “Next diff” and “Prev diff” buttons, you can step through any
changes that your recent work has made in the transcript.</p>

<p>There’s more to using the Skein and Transcript than we’ve covered in
this brief overview. After you’ve been writing in Inform for a while,
you’ll start to see how useful these features can be.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-index">Using the Index</h3>

<div class="image-frame"><img src="images/project_index.jpg"></div>

<p>I really shouldn’t have buried a discussion of the Index panel in the
Inform IDE way back here in Chapter 10, but I didn’t know where else to
put it. Until you’ve learned a bit about Inform programming, what you
see in the Index may not make a lot of sense. Once you’ve started
working with Inform, however, you’ll find it extremely useful.</p>

<p>The Index only appears after you have successfully compiled your game
at least once in your current work session. Until the project has been
compiled, the Index panel will be empty.</p>

<p>Across the top of the Index panel are eight buttons. The Home button
(highlighted in blue in the image at left) displays a navigation page to
the Index as a whole. By clicking the other tabs along the top, you can
view Contents, Actions, Kinds, the Phrasebook, Rules, Scenes, or the
World of your story. Alternatively, clicking on any of the square
buttons will take you directly to one of the subsections of the
index.</p>

<p>The main point of the Index, as you might expect, is to make it easy
to find things in your project. Many of the items listed in the Index
have clickable buttons beside them. Clicking an orange button with a
curving arrow will take you to the place in the Source where that item
is first mentioned. Clicking on a gray magnifying glass button will open
up a page of details deep within the Index, where you’ll see more
detail. Clicking a blue question-mark button will take you to a page in
<em>Writing with Inform</em> where the item is discussed.</p>

<p>On the main pages within the index, each square (such as “A1 Grouped”
in the Actions index or “Lx Lexicon” in the Phrasebook index) has at
least one blue question-mark button next to it. If you’re not sure what
type of item is being displayed in a given portion of the Index, click
on this button to go to the page where it’s discussed. Then use the Back
arrow in the upper left corner to return to the Index page.</p>

<p>Blue-gray squares in the Index can be clicked to copy a bit of code
into your source code at the spot where your text entry cursor is
located. Under Innards in the Contents page, for instance, you’ll find
squares that can insert Use options. (These should normally be placed
just after your story title, at the very start of the source code.)</p>

<p>If you scroll down a bit in the Phrases display in the Phrasebook
page, you’ll find a long list headlined “Saying.” Beneath this are
individual things that can be put into say phrases, with gray + buttons.
Clicking these buttons will give you a more detailed description of such
things as “say ‘[time in words]’”. Similar gray buttons are found in the
Standards display of the Rules index. If you spend a little time reading
the information on these pages, you’ll learn a lot about what you can do
with Inform.</p>

<p>Much of the Index is devoted to Inform’s Standard Rules. But as you
develop your story, your own code will be fully incorporated into the
Index. After writing some Instead rules and successfully compiling the
game, you’ll find these rules listed in the Instead rulebook under
Rules/Standards. Any extensions you have included in your game will also
be indexed.</p>

<p>Under the World tab, you’ll find a graphic map showing all of your
rooms and the connections among them. Inform’s attempt to map
complicated layouts is not perfect (nor could it be). In <a href="../WI_25.html#section_18">WI 25.18</a>, you’ll find some
suggestions on how to improve the map. After a bit of tweaking if
necessary, this map can be exported as an EPS file, as explained in
<a href="../WI_25.html#section_19">WI 25.19</a>. You may find this convenient, but my own
preference is to create a PDF map by hand using a freeware drawing
program such as OpenOffice.</p>

<h3 id="replacing-rules-in-the-standard-library"><strong>Replacing Rules in the Standard Library</strong></h3>

<p>If you open up the extension called the Standard Rules, you’ll find
the guts of Inform 7. Or at least, the higher-level guts; there’s a
lower level, as explained at the end of this Chapter, in the section
“What does Inform 6 Have to Do with Inform 7?” The Standard Rules are
not exactly light reading, but you can start to get a better idea of
what’s going on in Inform by skimming them. You’ll find, for instance,
this bit of code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check an actor taking (this is the can&apos;t take scenery rule):\n\tif the noun is scenery:\n\t\tif the actor is the player:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;[regarding the noun][They&apos;re] hardly portable.&quot; (A);\n\t\tstop the action. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check an actor taking (this is the can't take scenery rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is scenery:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the actor is the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[regarding the noun][They're] hardly portable." (A);</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action. </div>
</div>

<p>This is the rule that produces the output “That’s hardly portable” if
the player tries to take something that’s scenery. But let’s say you
don’t care for this message. The way to make such changes is
<em>not</em> to edit the Standard Rules file. You can edit this file if
you feel compelled to, but you’re inviting disaster. Inform provides a
more elegant solution. The rule above, like most of the rules in the
Standard Library, has a name. It’s called the can’t take scenery rule.
If you want to replace this rule, perhaps to produce a message that you
like better, here’s how to do it:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check an actor taking (this is the new can&apos;t take scenery rule):\n\tif the noun is scenery:\n\t\tif the actor is the player:\n\t\t\tsay &quot;[regarding the noun][They&apos;re] not even faintly portable.&quot; (A);\n\t\tstop the action.\n\nThe new can&apos;t take scenery rule is listed instead of the  can&apos;t take scenery rule in the check taking rulebook.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check an actor taking (this is the new can't take scenery rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is scenery:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the actor is the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[regarding the noun][They're] not even faintly portable." (A);</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The new can't take scenery rule is listed instead of the  can't take scenery rule in the check taking rulebook.</div>
</div>

<p>If you only want to change the message for one particular scenery
object (or for a kind of scenery object), you can do it even more
easily:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Check an actor taking the boulder:\n\tsay &quot;You&apos;d give yourself a hernia.&quot;;\n\tstop the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Check an actor taking the boulder:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You'd give yourself a hernia.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action.</div>
</div>

<h3 id="helping-the-parser">Helping the Parser</h3>

<p>Sometimes a word in your game will be ambiguous &ndash; that is, the parser
will be able to interpret it in two or three different ways. When
possible, you should use unique words to refer to every object in your
game, but sometimes that’s just not possible.</p>

<p>A handy trick for helping the parser deal with this type of ambiguity
is to write a Does The Player Mean rule. The way to do this is explained
  in <a href="../WI_17.html#section_19">WI 17.19 Does the player mean&hellip;</a>. Other useful techniques are shown in <a href="../WI_17.html#section_17">WI 17.17 Context: understanding when&hellip;</a>, <a href="../WI_17.html#section_20">WI 17.20 Understanding mistakes</a>, and <a href="../WI_17.html#section_21">WI 17.21 Precedence</a>. One of my favorite techniques (from <a href="../WI_17.html#section_17">WI 17.17</a>) is writing Understand When
rules. We’ve seen a couple of these elsewhere in the <em>Handbook</em>.
Such a rule might look like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;cracked&quot; and &quot;chipped&quot; as the Ming vase when the Ming vase is broken.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "cracked" and "chipped" as the Ming vase when the Ming vase is broken.</div>
</div>

<p>When you put this rule in your code, the words “cracked” and
“chipped” will not be understood as referring to the vase if the vase is
not broken. Writing conditions that refer to specific scenes is also
useful:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Understand &quot;dismantled&quot; as the robot when Emergency Repairs is happening.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Understand "dismantled" as the robot when Emergency Repairs is happening.</div>
</div>

<h4 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h4>

<p>Inform’s parser tries to make intelligent guesses about what the
player means when she uses words like “it”, “them”, and “him” in
commands. But occasionally this mechanism will go astray. In a few
cases, such a lapse can seriously confuse the player. Consider this
transcript:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>put bullet in revolver</div>

<p>You put the bullet into the revolver.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>point it at dave</div>

<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>point revolver at dave</div>

<p>Dave backs away from you, saying, "No! No!"</p>
</div>

<p>In this case, the player understands that “it” is the revolver, but
the parser thinks “it” is the bullet. If the player only uses the
command containing “it”, she will conclude (erroneously) that Dave is
not intimidated by the loaded revolver. To solve this problem, you can
use the phrase “set pronouns from” in your code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`After inserting the bullet into the revolver:\n\tset pronouns from the revolver;\n\tcontinue the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">After inserting the bullet into the revolver:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;set pronouns from the revolver;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div>

<h3 id="clearing-the-screen">Clearing the Screen</h3>

<p>Some authors like to clear the screen when a new section of the story
begins. This can be a nice effect if the player is teleported to an
entirely new time or place, for instance. You can get that
effect using <a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Emily%20Short/Basic%20Screen%20Effects.i7x">Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short</a>:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.\n\nInstead of pushing the big red button:\n\tclear the screen;\n\tsay &quot;[line break]&quot;;\n\tsay &quot;You feel a brief tingling sensation...&quot;;\n\tmove the player to Phobos;\n\tif the player does not wear the helmet:\n\t\tsay &quot;A little too late, you realize you&apos;ve forgotten to don your helmet. There&apos;s no air on the surface of Phobos...&quot;;\n\t\tend the story saying &quot;You have died.&quot;;\n\telse:\n\t\tstop the action.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of pushing the big red button:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;clear the screen;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[line break]";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "You feel a brief tingling sensation&hellip;";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the player to Phobos;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not wear the helmet:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "A little too late, you realize you've forgotten to don your helmet. There's no air on the surface of Phobos&hellip;";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying "You have died.";</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;else:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action.</div>
</div>

<p>The key command here is obviously, “clear the screen”; the rest is
just window dressing. This command is defined in Basic Screen
Effects.</p>

<p>The reason for putting in a line break after clearing the screen is
because some IF interpreters print the first line after a
clear-the-screen command behind the status bar (at the top of the
window), which will make it invisible. The line break will cause “You
feel a brief tingling sensation&hellip;” to appear reliably on all
interpreters after the screen has been cleared. Note, however, that if
your game creates a status bar with two lines of text, you’ll need to
use two line breaks.</p>

<h3 id="i6-constants">I6 Constants</h3>

<p>As your game is compiled, Inform goes through two processes. First,
your source text and all of the extensions you’re using (plus the
Standard Rules) are turned into Inform 6 (I6) code. The I6 compiler then
runs, producing a playable .z8 or glulx game, depending on which format
you have chosen in the Settings tab. Occasionally, the compilation
process will stop at the second stage. This can happen for several
reasons, but one of the more common and less troublesome reasons is
because you’re using too much of something, and I6 thinks it’s running
out of room.</p>

<p>The Standard Rules define a series of constants, each of which
controls the amount of memory available in the game for a certain type
of data. Here’s the list:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`\n    Use ALLOC_CHUNK_SIZE of 32000.\nUse MAX_ARRAYS of 10000.\nUse MAX_CLASSES of 200.\nUse MAX_VERBS of 255.\nUse MAX_LABELS of 10000.\nUse MAX_ZCODE_SIZE of 500000.\nUse MAX_STATIC_DATA of 180000.\nUse MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 200000.\nUse MAX_INDIV_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 20000.\nUse MAX_STACK_SIZE of 65536.\nUse MAX_SYMBOLS of 20000.\nUse MAX_EXPRESSION_NODES of 256.\nUse MAX_LABELS of 200000.\nUse MAX_LOCAL_VARIABLES of 256.\n\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>  
<div class="codeline">    Use ALLOC_CHUNK_SIZE of 32000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_ARRAYS of 10000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_CLASSES of 200.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_VERBS of 255.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_LABELS of 10000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_ZCODE_SIZE of 500000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_STATIC_DATA of 180000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 200000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_INDIV_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 20000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_STACK_SIZE of 65536.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_SYMBOLS of 20000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_EXPRESSION_NODES of 256.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_LABELS of 200000.</div>
<div class="codeline">Use MAX_LOCAL_VARIABLES of 256.</div>
</div>

<p>If you receive a message from the compiler saying that one of these
values has been exceeded, all you need to do is write a line at the top
of your source code increasing it. (It goes without saying that you
should <em>never</em> edit the Standard Rules themselves.) For
instance:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use MAX_STATIC_DATA of 360000.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use MAX_STATIC_DATA of 360000.</div>
</div>

<p>With a large game, I’ve had to increase MAX_DICT_ENTRIES to 5000 to
make room for more vocabulary words. (MAX_DICT_ENTRIES doesn’t seem to
be in the Standard Rules. I have no idea where its default value is
defined.)</p>

<p>Increasing a value is easy to do &ndash; but you might be wondering, what’s
going on here? According to Inform guru Andrew Plotkin, MAX_STATIC_DATA
“is the compiler's workspace for array data. I7 uses this for tables,
and for storage space for relations, indexed text, dynamic lists, and
other on-the-fly work. The short answer is no, [needing to increase it]
shouldn’t alarm you; 360 kilobytes is  pocket change for computers these
days. On the other hand, a future Glulx interpreter running on a phone
or a Web browser might not be so  sanguine. If you’re doing something
which costs a huge amount of memory (such as a many-to-many relation),
and it’s not necessary [to your game], getting rid of it can only help
performance.”</p>

<h3 id="relations">Relations</h3>

<p>Relations are explained in <a href="../WI_13.html">Chapter 13 of <em>Writing
with Inform</em></a>. They give Inform some extra power, but seeing how best
to use that power may not be easy. Relations can do at least two kinds
of things, and probably others &ndash; I haven’t used them much, so I’m not
sure.</p>

<p>First, relations can allow us to write about what’s going on in the
model world in ways that are shorter and easier to understand when
reading the code. Second, relations can be used to manage how bunches of
objects … well, how they relate to one another.</p>

<p>For a couple of examples of the first usage, see <a href="../WI_13.html#section_9">WI 13.9 Defining new assertion
verbs</a>. There, some new verbs are defined, which can then be used in
code. Here’s another example, this one my own:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Proximity relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when the\nholder of X is the holder of Y. The verb to jostle (he jostles, he\njostled, it is jostled, he is jostling) implies the proximity\nrelation.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Proximity relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when the</div>
<div class="codeline">holder of X is the holder of Y. The verb to jostle (he jostles, he</div>
<div class="codeline">jostled, it is jostled, he is jostling) implies the proximity</div>
<div class="codeline">relation.</div>
</div>

<p>If you need to make a decision in the game based on whether two
objects are in the same container, or on the same supporter, or in the
same room (directly in the room &ndash; on the floor), or carried by the same
person, you would normally write something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the holder of the apple is the holder of the orange:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the holder of the apple is the holder of the orange:</div>
</div>

<p>But after creating a proximity relation as shown above, you can
simplify this test a bit by writing:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the apple jostles the orange:\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the apple jostles the orange:</div>
</div>

<p>I’ve defined the word “jostles” using a relation. Any unused word
would serve &ndash; “snuggles” or “elbows”, for instance (but probably not “is
able to touch”, since Inform already knows how to test whether a
character “can touch” an object).</p>

<p>Various Examples in <a href="../WI_13.html">Chapter 13 of <em>Writing with Inform</em></a> show
how the interactions among groups of people can be managed using
relations. These examples are worth studying in detail. If you’re
wondering whether it would be worth your while to spend the time on it,
here’s an imaginary example that may make the use of relations slightly
easier to understand.</p>

<p>Imagine a game in which the player plays the part of Cupid, complete
with bow and arrow. To win the game, you need to shoot Jason with an
arrow, shoot Jennifer with an arrow, and then get Jason and Jennifer
into the same room so that they fall in love.</p>

<p>If they wander into the same room, the software will need to be able
to figure out whether each of them has been shot with an arrow and is
ready for love. That’s the easy part. All we need to do is write a few
assertions along the lines of “A person can be ready-for-love.” If Jason
has been shot and is ready-for-love, he’ll fall in love with Jennifer
when he sees her (assuming we write code that will make him do so). But
Jennifer might not have been shot yet, so she might not fall in love
with Jason when she sees him.</p>

<p>There’s no real need to use relations to manage this game. You can do
something simple, with properties, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Jason can be ready-for-love or not ready-for-love. Jason can be loving-Jennifer or not loving-Jennifer.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Jason can be ready-for-love or not ready-for-love. Jason can be loving-Jennifer or not loving-Jennifer.</div>
</div>

<p>&hellip;and similar properties for Jennifer. When Jason is loving-Jennifer
and Jennifer is loving-Jason, the player has won the game. We don’t need
relations here, because these two properties will do the job nicely.</p>

<p>But now imagine that the game includes Steve, Bill, Ted, Ralph, and
Jason; and also Jennifer, Susan, Beth, Amy, and Helen. Any one of them
can fall in love with any of the others, and vice-versa! If we try to use properties, the list of
properties each character will need is going to be rather long, and
managing these properties in such a way as to avoid bugs will be quite
tricky. To manage the potential romantic tangles that can arise during
the game in a more reliable way, a better approach will be to use
relations.</p>

<p>The code for this game would almost certainly include the example
sentence in <a href="../WI_13.html#section_5">WI 13.5 Loving relates various people to
one person</a>. We would have to write more code in order to cause
characters who have been shot with one of Cupid’s arrows to fall in love
with the next suitable person they see. I’m not going to do that here,
but it’s not actually a bad idea for a game. I hope someone will try it.
Once a character is ready-for-love and sees an appropriate romantic
object, all we need to write is:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now Steve loves Susan;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now Steve loves Susan;</div>
</div>

<p>If Steve has previously been in love with Amy, that one line of code
will automatically make him fall out of love with Amy, because the
statement “Loving relates various people to one person” allows a person
to love only one other person at a time. That’s the power of relations:
Relations can manage the various combinations a lot more easily.</p>

<p>If you’re using relations in your game, you can take advantage of the
debugging command RELATIONS, which prints out a list of all the
relations that are currently active among the objects in your game.</p>

<p>Here’s a more complete (and more practical) example of how to use
relations. In this short game, we want the player to have to stand on a
chair in order to touch the chandelier. But it’s not enough to stand on
the chair: The chair has to be positioned correctly beneath the
chandelier. In addition to a new action (putting it beneath), we need to
define a relation that will keep track of whether something is beneath
something else. Whenever the player picks up an object, we need to get
rid of the relation. And just to keep things tidy, we’ll also create a
new property, high or low. The player will only be able to put things
beneath things that are high. In a game where the player is allowed to
put a coaster underneath a glass, or a silver dollar underneath a sofa
cushion, the high/low property might get in the way, and the rules for
the putting it beneath action would naturally be more complicated. But
this example could easily be adapted so as to force the player to put a
chair beneath a high shelf in order to get something off of the shelf,
for example.</p>

<h3 id="adding-hints">Adding Hints</h3>

<p>My personal belief (some people don’t agree) is that almost any work
of IF that includes puzzles should have a complete set of built-in
hints. The bad thing about hints is that they can make it too easy for
the player. Instead of exercising her brain-power, she can just look up
a hint, slam through the puzzle, and move on to the next part of the
game.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a player who gets stuck in the middle of a game
and has no way of getting unstuck may just set the game aside and never
come back to it. If you care about having players enjoy your game from
start to finish, I hope you’ll at least consider providing a hint menu.
It’s a little extra work, but many players will appreciate it.</p>

<p>A well-written series of hints will first nudge the player gently
toward the solution of each puzzle. If the player asks for more hints,
they’ll become broader and more obvious. The last hint in each list
should provide a complete, step-by-step solution to the puzzle. If
you’re tempted to write just a couple of hints for each puzzle and then
stop by saying something like, “Well, it should be obvious to you by
now,” I hope you’ll consider that some of your players may want to shoot
you. This can’t be viewed as a desirable outcome.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it’s sporting to offer the player a chance to
disable the hints so as not to be tempted.</p>

<p>A good extension to use for adding hints to your game is <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Eric%20Eve/Adaptive%20Hints-v7.i7x">Adaptive
Hints by Eric Eve</a>. While the commands the player uses to navigate the
hint system are clumsy, the functionality is there. The documentation
for this extension is thorough and easy to follow, so there’s no reason
to discuss it here. One nice thing about Adaptive Hints is that the
contents of the Hint menu can be changed during the course of the game.
This helps prevent “spoilers.” For instance, if the player consults the
hints early in the game, it would be a terrible spoiler to find a hint
listed as “How do I get the jewels out of the stomach of the shark?”
before the player has encountered a shark or knows about the jewels.
Using Adaptive Hints, you can cause that hint to appear only after the
player has reached a point in the game where it makes sense for the hint
to be available. To keep track of whether the player has seen the shark
or knows about the jewels, <a href="https://github.com/ganelson/inform/blob/master/inform7/Internal/Extensions/Eric%20Eve/Epistemology.i7x">Epistemology by Eric Eve</a> is the tool of
choice.</p>

<h3 id="special-features-in-glulx">Special Features in Glulx</h3>

<p>In <a href="../WI_23.html">Chapter 23 of <em>Writing with Inform</em>,
Figures, Sounds and Files</a>, you’ll find a good discussion of how to add
graphics files (digital photos or clip art in .jpg or .png format) to
your game. To do so, you’ll need to compile to glulx, not to .z8.</p>

<p>Displaying graphics in a game can be a good way to give the game an
extra dimension &ndash; but not all IF interpreters will display graphics.
Some interpreters are <em>text-only.</em> In addition, some IF players
are blind or visually impaired. One of the reasons these folks like IF
is because they can play the games using screen-reader software. For
these reasons, it’s probably not a good idea to write a puzzle in such a
way that an essential clue is found only in a graphic image. Think of
graphics as enhancements.</p>

<p>The same chapter in the Documentation also discusses including sound
files briefly. But again, you’ll be at the mercy of the interpreter the
player happens to be using. Support for sound playback in IF is
generally not too reliable, so I’d suggest not worrying too much about
this feature.</p>

<p>The glulx game format also supports opening several windows at once
within the interpreter’s main window. With this feature, you could
display graphics in one sub-window and have the text game running in
another sub-window. Instructions on how to use this feature are beyond
the scope of this <em>Handbook.</em></p>

<p>The current version of the Glulx specification is very limited when
it comes to text styles. Emily Short’s extension Glulx Text Effects does
a nice job of illustrating what’s possible.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What Does Inform 6 Have to Do with Inform 7?</h3>

<p>In this <em>Handbook</em>, I’ve deliberately avoided getting too far
into the deep end of Inform programming. If you work with Inform 7 for a
while, though, you’ll start to see occasional mentions of Inform 6.</p>

<p>In a technical sense, Inform 7 is built “on top of” Inform 6. Inform
6 is still being used behind the scenes when your game is compiled. But
this fact is normally well hidden from the I7 programmer, and there’s no
reason why most authors need to concern themselves with it.</p>

<p>Once in a while, an expert programmer will want to achieve an effect
that can only be achieved by including some I6 code in an I7 game. If
you look at the code in a few extensions written by experts, you’ll
probably see Inform 6 peeking through the curtain. Here’s a line from an
extension by Emily Short that I chose at random:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Use direct event handling translates as (- Constant DIRECT_GLK_EVENT_HANDLING; -).\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Use direct event handling translates as (- Constant DIRECT_GLK_EVENT_HANDLING; -).</div>
</div>

<p>The parentheses and hyphens are what tells the compiler “Here’s some
Inform 6 code.” What that particular line does … I don’t know, and it
doesn’t matter. For more details on how Inform 6 code can be included in
Inform 7 code, you can look at <a href="../WI_27.html#section_14">WI 27.14: Using
    Inform 6 within Inform 7</a>
  through <a href="../WI_27.html#section_24">WI 27.24: Inform 6
adjectives</a>. But the things you can do
with I6 code are far beyond the scope of this <em>Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: Writing a game in Inform 7 is like driving a
car down the road. Adding I6 code to an I7 game is like pulling over,
popping the hood, and tinkering with the fuel pump. Once in a while,
that may be the only way to get where you want to go, but you shouldn’t
need to do it too often, and nobody but an expert mechanic should try it
at all.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-inform-7-the-ultimate-if-programming-language">So, Is Inform 7 the Ultimate IF Programming Language?</h3>

<p>Given the popularity of Inform 7 and the ease with which newcomers
can use it to start creating their own interactive fiction, it wouldn’t
be surprising if people get the impression it’s the best IF development
system that could ever be imagined. It would be wrong for this
<em>Handbook</em> to draw to a close without commenting on that
impression.</p>

<p>For all its strengths, Inform has some surprising weaknesses, some of
them trivial, others a bit more awkward to deal with. A few of them have
been touched on in the course of this book. Obviously, I feel that
Inform is a very good language with which to approach writing
interactive fiction, especially if you’re new to computer programming.
But my enthusiasm has more to do with Inform’s approachability &ndash; its
“natural language” syntax and its cross-platform IDE &ndash; than with the
nuts and bolts of its design.</p>

<p>Some of its limitations seem to have arisen out of Graham Nelson’s
desire to preserve backward compatibility with older IF systems &ndash; not
just Inform 6 but earlier systems dating back to the 1980s, when Infocom
was still an active company releasing new text-based games. The fact
that a game’s release number (displayed in the banner at the beginning
of the game) can’t have decimal places, but can only be an integer,
seems to have no rational basis other than the fact that that’s how
Infocom did it. Today, the standard in version numbering often includes
not one but two decimal points &ndash; version 1.5.2, for instance. Inform
just plain can’t number your game’s version that way.</p>

<p>To be sure, that’s a trivial issue. A more serious example is the
separation between .z8 game files on the one hand and Glulx files on the
other. The Z-machine format is an artifact of a bygone era. In those
days, computers typically had less than a megabyte of memory, so the .z8
format simply can’t be used with large files. There’s no real reason why
this format should still be supported today, except for the large
installed base of Z-machine interpreters. On the other hand, the
Z-machine is actually more powerful than a Glulx interpreter in a few
restricted circumstances having to do with type styles; Glulx is, at
this writing, still rather poor at allowing the author to create a
variety of new type styles.</p>

<p>Other limitations or odd design choices seem to have arisen due to
the piecemeal fashion in which Inform was developed. Because its syntax
is very unlike the syntax of any other programming language, and because
Nelson wanted the code to read as much like English as possible, he
seems to have made some choices along the way that were less
systematically consistent than <em>ad hoc</em>. If you’ve created a
backdrop called the sky, for instance, you’ll find that in some code
statements you can refer simply to “the sky”, while in others you have
to refer to “the sky backdrop,” as explained in <a href="../WI_8.html#section_8">WI 8.8</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that doors can’t be moved probably simplifies the way Inform
works internally, but in terms of the limitations it places on the
author, it was a poor design choice. No more need be said about
that.</p>

<p>Another limitation, and one that is of concern to a lot of authors,
is that Inform insists that all of the code for your game be stored in a
single file. No other modern programming language operates this way; the
norm among programmers is to store the code for a single project in
several files, which can be edited (and compiled) separately. There are
several reasons why forcing all the code for a game to live in a single
file was a debatable design choice: It makes collaborating with other
authors more difficult, it makes editing more difficult, and so on. The
fact that the code file is always called story.ni can also become a
problem, because it makes the process of archiving successive versions
of a single project during development a bit more cumbersome and
error-prone than it needs to be.</p>

<p>At the code design level, Inform doesn’t allow multiple inheritance.
For instance, a single object can’t be both a device and a supporter.
Lacking the ability to create such an object, the author has to choose a
workaround in order to create as standard an in-game object as a stove.
The workarounds are not, in most cases, difficult to work with. Usually,
you can make one object a part of another object, and you’ll be ready to
move on. For that matter, Inform’s device class is so bare-bones that
there’s almost no reason to use it at all. But the absence of multiple
inheritance can occasionally force the author to perform a few
gyrations.</p>

<p>If you want to really master the deepest level of Inform 7
programming, you’ll have no choice but to learn an entirely new and much
more abstract set of code syntax: Inform 6. Learning two separate coding
systems means extra work. To be sure, Inform is not the only computer
language that works this way: Musicians who use Csound, for instance,
can get at some of its deeper features only by learning to program in
Python or C. But most interactive fiction authoring systems are not
bifurcated in this way. TADS 3 can be entirely customized by writing new
code that uses exactly the same syntax you would use to write your game
(though the extensive use of macros and templates in game programming
somewhat obscures this fact). TADS has a much more extensive built-in
library than Inform, implements multiple inheritance, and handles type
styles, clickable hyperlinks, and multimedia. (Also, the TADS Workbench
has tools for professional-level debugging, such as stepping through the
code one line at a time. On the other hand, Workbench is a Windows-only
program. To use it on a MacOS or Linux computer, you have to run a
Windows emulator.)</p>

<p>In sum &ndash; no, Inform 7 is not the be-all or end-all. Even so, there’s
no denying that it’s powerful, popular, well-supported, and quite easy
to use, and has a number of terrific features. For many aspiring
authors, it will be absolutely the right choice. Because it’s still
being developed, certain of the issues mentioned in this concluding
section of the 2009 edition of the <em>Handbook</em> have already been
dealt with. And the developers of extensions for Inform have added, and
continue to add, some powerful and unexpected capabilities. If you’re
new to writing IF, you need have no fear that in choosing Inform 7,
you’re painting yourself into a corner or headed down a dark alley. You
can have confidence that you’re making a wise choice, that you’ll be
able to produce games of amazing complexity and high quality.</p>

<p>All it takes is thick slabs of inspiration and months of hard work,
coupled with generous amounts of head-scratching, hair-pulling, and
teeth-grinding. Really, you hardly ever need to throw your computer
across the room in sheer frustration. Once in a while, you may notice
that you’re actually having fun. And that’s the point, isn’t it?</p>

which some part of the game takes place. (See <a
href="#creating-your-first-room">Creating Your First Room</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>rule:</strong> An instruction that tells Inform what to do in
a certain situation. Rules are gathered together by the compiler into
rulebooks.</p>

<p><strong>scene:</strong> A portion of your game that is structured so
as to happen during a certain period of time. (See <a
href="#scenes">Scenes</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>scenery:</strong> A property that can be applied to things
(including doors, supporters, and so on). When a thing is scenery, it
will not be mentioned automatically in the game when the room
description is printed; your room description will need to supply all
mentions of scenery, so that the player will know the scenery object
exists. Scenery can’t be picked up and carried around by the player.
(See <a href="#scenery">Scenery</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>scope:</strong> The portion of the model world that is
currently available to the player. Usually the scope is the same as the
room the player is in, but in some special situations it may be
different. (See <a href="#Ref_scope">scope</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>second noun:</strong> A term that refers to the second object
the player mentioned in a two-object command. For instance, if the
player’s most recent command was PUT THE BALL IN THE BOX, the value “the
second noun” would refer to the box object.</p>

<p><strong>Skein:</strong> A panel in the Inform 7 IDE that keeps track
of and can replay all of your testing sessions with your project (or at
least a large number of recent sessions).</p>

<p><strong>source code:</strong> Also called source text &ndash; what you
write in the Source panel of Inform’s IDE.</p>

<p><strong>status line:</strong> The strip across the top of the window
in a running game. Various types of information, such as the room name,
score, and time of day within the game, can be displayed in the status
line. (See <a href="#Ref_status_line">status line</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>supporter:</strong> A kind of object in an Inform game. A
supporter is an object like a table, that other objects in the game can
be placed <em>on</em>. (See <a
href="#containers-supporters">Containers &amp; Supporters</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>switch:</strong> A group of lines (see <a
href="#Ref_switch_statement">switch statement</a>) of code. Inform will choose one
line from the group depending on the current value of some variable.</p>

<p><strong>table:</strong> A data structure in which Inform can store
related data in rows and columns. (See <a
href="#tables">Tables</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>thing:</strong> The basic kind of object in an Inform game.
Doors, supporters, containers, and even people are all things, but the
term “thing” is sometimes used to refer specifically to movable objects
that aren’t of any other kind.</p>

<p><strong>truth state:</strong> A kind of variable that can have only
one of two values &ndash; true or false. (See <a
href="#Ref_truth_state">truth state</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>variable:</strong> A value that changes while the game is
running. A variable can be a number or an object, for example. (See
<a href="#Ref_variable">variable</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>verbose mode:</strong> A mode of gameplay in which complete
room descriptions are printed each time the player enters a room. (See
<a href="#Ref_brief_mode">brief mode</a>.) Verbose mode is the opposite of
brief mode.</p>

<p><strong>virtual machine:</strong> A piece of software that creates a
sort of “box” inside which other software (such as an Inform game) can
run. It’s called a “virtual” machine because it isn’t an actual hardware
machine.</p>

<p><strong>visible thing:</strong> An object that is somewhere in the
model world of the game, but not necessarily visible to the player at
this moment. (See p. <a href="#Ref_visible_thing">visible thing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>wearable:</strong> A property of things. Wearable things can
be worn by the player, or by other characters.</p>

<p><strong>Z-code:</strong> A type of compiled game that is compatible
with the Z-machine. Inform can produce Z-code games in the .z8
format.</p>

<p><strong>Z-machine:</strong> An interpreter that can run games written
in Inform. (Large games and games with special features such as graphics
are written using Inform’s Glulx format, which is not compatible with
the Z-machine.) Z-machine interpreters are available for most computer
platforms, including many obsolete operating systems and some portable
devices.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-b-updating-older-extensions">Appendix B: Updating Older Extensions</h2>

<p>Extensions are an important and convenient way of extending the
functionality of Inform 7. Many of them are available. Older extensions
are archived on the Inform 7 website, and can be downloaded from there &ndash;
but they won’t necessarily work with 6L38. In fact, they probably won’t.
If you want to try, find your Inform Extensions folder (in Windows it’s
in My Documents), add a folder named after the author of the extension,
and put the .i7x file in this folder. The next time you launch Inform,
the extension will appear in the Extensions pane.</p>

<p>By the time you read this, more of the older extensions may have
migrated to the wonderful new Public Library. This feature eliminates
the need to check the Inform 7 website for new or updated extensions &ndash;
just go to the Public Library tab under the Extensions tab, scroll down
to the bottom, and click the download button. But if an extension that
you’d like to use isn’t available in the Public Library, you may want to
grab it from inform7.com and try to update it yourself.</p>

<p>Some older extensions may work in the latest version of Inform
without any changes. <a href="https://github.com/i7/archive/blob/master/Michael%20Callaghan/Patrollers.i7x">Patrollers by Michael Callaghan</a>, for instance,
seems to require no changes. With other extensions, the needed changes
may be so massive that considerable study may be required. In between
these two categories, however, are some extensions that can easily be
tidied up. If you see one on the Inform 7 website’s Extensions page that
you think might be useful, feel free to download it, install it by
putting it in a folder in your Extensions folder, and give it a try.</p>

<p>At this writing, for instance, <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/10.1/Jon%20Ingold/Far%20Away-v5.i7x">Far Away by Jon Ingold</a>, which is
designed to deal with things that can be seen in the distance but are
too far away to be touched, has not been upgraded for 6L38
compatibility. Updating it turns out to be quite easy.</p>

<p>After installing it, open it in the Inform IDE from File &gt; Open
Extensions &gt; Jon Ingold. The main incompatibility in this Extension
is that it uses the old “change … to” syntax, which is no longer
supported. The new syntax is “now … is”. Use the Find command to find
all instances of the word “change” and edit those lines so that they
read, for example:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`now the far-off-object is n;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">now the far-off-object is n;</div>
</div>

<p>Only one other change is needed. Inform no longer uses the word
“consider” for sending the game off to a list of rules in the Standard
Rules. The new term is “follow.” So this line:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`consider the distant-objects rules for the far-off-object;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">consider the distant-objects rules for the far-off-object;</div>
</div>

<p>won’t compile until you change “consider” to “follow.”</p>

<p>The code “if using … option” is another non-functional bit of syntax.
In <a href="https://github.com/i7/archive/blob/master/Jon%20Ingold/Considerate%20Holdall.i7x">Considerate Holdall by Jon Ingold</a>, for example, we find this
line:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if not using the inline implicit library option, disallow\nstashing;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if not using the inline implicit library option, disallow</div>
<div class="codeline">stashing;</div>
</div>

<p>This syntax has to be changed to “if the … option is active”:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`if the inline implicit library option is active, disallow\nstashing;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">if the inline implicit library option is active, disallow</div>
<div class="codeline">stashing;</div>
</div>

<p>Both Considerate Holdall and another useful extension, Secret Doors
by Andrew Owen, suffer from a different problem. They rely on an
outdated method of printing messages for the player to read.
(Considerate Holdall also has two lines where the word “when” is
duplicated, but that’s easy to fix.) Here are the two code blocks in
Considerate Holdall that don’t work:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To print the you can&apos;t go message:<br />\n    (- L__M(##Go, 2, 0); -).<br />\n<br />\nTo print the you can&apos;t see message:<br />\n    (- L__M(##Miscellany, 30, 0); -).\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To print the you can't go message:<br /></div>
<div class="codeline">    (- L__M(##Go, 2, 0); -).<br /></div>
<div class="codeline"><br /></div>
<div class="codeline">To print the you can't see message:<br /></div>
<div class="codeline">    (- L__M(##Miscellany, 30, 0); -).</div>
</div>

<p>The L__M refers to Library Messages, a system that Inform no longer
employs. By taking a cruise through the Standard Rules, you can find the
new method of printing these messages, and edit the code so that it
looks like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To print the you can&apos;t go message:\n\tsay &quot;[We] [can&apos;t go] that way.&quot;\nTo print the you can&apos;t see message:\n\tsay &quot;[We] [can&apos;t] see any such thing.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To print the you can't go message:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[We] [can't go] that way."</div>
<div class="codeline">To print the you can't see message:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[We] [can't] see any such thing."</div>
</div>

<p>Once you’ve made these changes, Secret Doors will work just fine.</p>

<p>A bigger problem in some extensions is procedural rules. At one time,
these were used to bypass normal rules in the Standard Library under
certain conditions, but they’re no longer allowed. One way to get around
this is to write a new rule that replaces the normal rule, insert it in
place of the normal rule, and add the required conditions to it. The
handy phrase “do nothing” has the effect of bypassing the rule. Here’s a
quick example, not from an extension but from the 2009 edition of this
<em>Handbook.</em> The “Dangerous Jewel Box” example in Appendix C
originally contained this code:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A procedural rule: if taking gems when the jewel box is dangerous\nthen ignore the announce items from multiple object lists rule.\n\nA procedural rule: if removing gems from the jewel box when the jewel\nbox is dangerous then ignore the announce items from multiple object\nlists rule.\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">A procedural rule: if taking gems when the jewel box is dangerous</div>
<div class="codeline">then ignore the announce items from multiple object lists rule.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A procedural rule: if removing gems from the jewel box when the jewel</div>
<div class="codeline">box is dangerous then ignore the announce items from multiple object</div>
<div class="codeline">lists rule.</div>
</div>

<p>The idea behind this code, obviously, was to bypass the “announce
items from multiple object lists rule” in one specific game situation.
Here’s how the same code looks today &ndash; a new rule that replaces the old
rule, checks the game-specific situation, and says “do nothing” if
that’s what’s needed:</p></div>
<div class="codeblock" id="Ref_new_rule_(replace)">
<div class="codeline">This is the new announce items from multiple object lists rule:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the current item from the multiple object list is not nothing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if taking gems when the jewel box is dangerous:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;else if removing gems from the jewel box when the jewel box is dangerous:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;else:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[current item from the multiple object list]: [run paragraph on]".</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The new announce items from multiple object lists rule is listed instead of the announce items from multiple object lists rule in the action-processing rules.</div>
</div>

<h2 id="appendix-c-short-sample-games">Appendix C: Short Sample Games</h2>

<p>In this appendix you’ll find a few miniature games that illustrate
various techniques. These games are a bit too complex to fit well within
the main flow of the <em>Handbook,</em> so they’re gathered here
instead, in no particular order.</p>

<h3 id="flea-market">Flea Market</h3>

<p>We’ll start with a simple scenario that was suggested by Jay in a
post on the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction, back in the day when it was
still a go-to place for IF info. Jay’s goal was to make NPCs respond at
random to items carried by the player. Each time the player takes
inventory, one of the other shoppers in the flea market will notice some
random thing the player carries, and comment on it.</p>

<p>This example illustrates four techniques: calling a function,
creating a definition, using what computer programmers call a
<em>switch</em> statement, and using a while loop.</p>

<p>Inform’s switch statement (see <a href="../WI_11.html#section_8">WI 11.8: Otherwise</a>) <span
id="Ref_switch_statement" class="anchor"></span>uses a double hyphen to
indicate the various entries in the switch block. Only one of the lines
in a switch block will be run at any given time. (A note to programmers:
Inform doesn’t require break statements in switch statements.) In this
case, we enter the switch block by selecting a random number between 1
and 5 and then choosing a say statement based on the value of the random
number.</p>

<p>We’re creating a function (“To say the desire”) and passing it two
arguments &ndash; a person and a thing. Within the function, we refer to the
person as P and the thing as J. There’s nothing special about these
symbols; we could just as easily have written “To say the desire of
(dude - a person) for (stuff - a thing)” and then referred to “[dude]”
and “[stuff]” in the say statements.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tif a random number from 1 to 5 is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been looking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot; \n\nAfter taking inventory: \n\tif nothing is held by the player or the player is alone: \n\t\trule succeeds; \n\totherwise: \n\t\tlet shopper be the player; \n\t\twhile shopper is the player: \n\t\t\tlet shopper be a random person in the location; \n\t\tlet junk be a random thing held by the player; \n\t\tsay &quot;[the desire of shopper for junk]&quot;. \n\nDefinition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): </div>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking inventory: </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise: </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[the desire of shopper for junk]". </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1. </div>
</div>

<p>The After rule causes nothing to happen if the player is alone or is
carrying nothing. Before entering the while statement in the After rule,
we define a variable called shopper, and give it the value of the
player. When the while statement starts, shopper is the player. The
while statement is a loop. It will execute over and over, randomly
picking one person after another in the location, until the person it
picks is <em>not</em> the player. This is what we want; if the shopper
is still the player, the output of the switch statement will be
something like, “yourself edges closer to you and says wistfully&hellip;”.
Once the shopper is not yourself, the condition (while shopper is the
player) becomes false, the loop ends, and the rest of the After rule
runs. The rule chooses a random thing held by the player, combines it
with the randomly chosen NPC, and says the desire of the random person
for the random thing.</p>

<p>The definition is simple: We need to tell Inform what we mean by
“alone,” because the “After taking inventory” rule needs to check this.
Can you see what will happen if the “After taking inventory” rule
doesn’t include the condition “if … the player is alone”? If the player
ever takes inventory when no one else is in the location, the rule will
go into an endless loop. The while statement will keep trying forever to
find an NPC in the location, but it will always end up choosing the
player.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Flea Market is a room. &quot;All manner of things are for sale here, lined up in rows on folding tables.&quot; \n\nA folding table is a supporter in the Flea Market.

</div>

<p>Since we don’t know what the player may be carrying or who may be in
the location, we pretty much have to choose NPCs and held items at
random. However, when items are selected at random, Inform will
sometimes select the same item several times in a row. This can result
in a repeating output, which will make the game seem wooden &ndash; but in a
real game there might be only one NPC in the location, or the player
might be carrying only one item, so repetition is not avoidable. If
you’d prefer to minimize the repetition, you can at least step through
the list of entries in the “To say the desire” rule in a repeating
order, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The desire-index is a number that varies. The desire-index is 0.\n\nTo say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tincrease the desire-index by 1;\n\tif the desire-index is greater than 5:\n\t\tnow the desire-index is 1;\n\tif the desire-index is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been \nlooking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot;\n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">The desire-index is a number that varies.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 2: say "'That's sure a swell-looking [J],' says [P]."; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 3: say "[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, 'I've been </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 5: say "'Wow, that's a really nice [J],' [P] says enviously."</div>
</div>

<p>Here,
we’ve created a global variable (desire-index). It’s global so that it
will persist throughout the game; a local variable within a rule will be
destroyed when the rule finishes. We then increase the desire-index by 1
each time the rule runs and check to see if it has gone past 5. If so,
we reset it to 1. Now the five statements will be used in the order
shown, over and over (but with random people and random things).</p>

</div>

<p>The point of the “say attachment-list” code is that we want to append
a list of Mr Potato Head’s features to his description. Just to make
things slightly more interesting, the lips are plural-named, so if the
lips are part of Mr Potato Head we need to increase the count by 1 in
order to print out “are” rather than “is” if the lips are the only
feature that has been attached.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll create some facial attachments, and also an irrelevant
item (the banana) for testing purposes.</p>

<p>In creating our new detaching it from action, we also need to
consider that the player’s most likely command is simply TAKE NOSE. The
parser’s default response would be, “That seems to be a part of Mr
Potato Head.” Inform very sensibly doesn’t let the player go around
removing the parts of things. So we need another Instead rule to map
TAKE NOSE onto the detaching it from action.</p>

<h3 id="a-dangerous-jewel-box">A Dangerous Jewel Box</h3>

<p>The next example shows a way of printing out a single message when
the player tries to take several items and is prevented from doing so.
There are three jewels in the jewel box, and if the box is in its
dangerous state, we want the player character’s fingers to be zapped by
an electric shock if he tries to get the jewels from the box. But what
we don’t want is an output that looks like this:</p>

<div class="game-output">
<div class="command"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take jewels</div>

<p>ruby: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

<p>diamond: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

<p>sapphire: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>
</div>

<p>This would be silly, because the player character would naturally
stop after being shocked the first time. Getting the output to read
nicely turns out to be complicated, because there are many possible
conditions that might occur in the game. The box might be safe rather
than dangerous (this is handled in the example with the command TURN
CARVING). The player might make the box safe, take two jewels, drop them
on the floor, make the box dangerous again, and then try TAKE JEWELS.
What should happen then?</p>

<p>The extension <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/master/John%20Clemens/Consolidated%20Multiple%20Actions.i7x">Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens</a>, which
was recently updated by Emily Short for 6L38 compatibility, can handle
this type of scenario &ndash; but it only works in Glulx games. If you don’t
need or want all of its functionality, studying the code below will show
you how to handle this type of situation.</p>

<p>The heavy lifting is done by the “Before taking gems” rule. Note that
if one or more gems are available for taking, this rule has to handle
the process manually. It can’t include, near the end, the line “try
taking item”, because that will cause Inform to try running the entire
rule again. It will produce a loop, which will result in a run-time
error.</p>

<h3 id="the-omega-machine">The Omega Machine</h3>

<p>This sophisticated example showed up back in 2009 on the
intfiction.org forum. The author, who goes by the handle SJ_43, was
responding to <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/i7-giving-orders-to-a-device-format-is-name-order/677">a question from someone named Eudoxia about how to make a
device that the player can give commands to</a> &ndash; for instance, a command
like COMPUTER, CHECK THE STABILIZERS. The game below doesn’t implement
anything quite that complicated, but it provides a framework with which
you could easily do it. The sneaky Inform 6 trick in this code is the
line, “Include (- has talkable, -) when defining a computer.” The
parentheses and dashes are used (as described in <a
href="#what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What Does Inform 6 Have to Do with Inform 7</a>) to drop the
code out of I7 and down into I6. “has talkable” is I6 code that means,
more or less, “This is an object the player may want to be able to talk
to.”</p>

<p>Note that the Default Messages extension may change or not be
compatible with a future version of Inform 7. It’s used here to create a
special error message for devices of the computer kind.</p>

<p>I’ve customized SJ_43’s code by adding some calendar messages for
Omega. In a real game, you’d probably want to store such messages in a
table, so as to be able to refer to different messages at different
points in the game.</p>

<h3 id="the-lurking-critter">The Lurking Critter</h3>

<p>This example, which was inspired by an answer that Mike Gentry gave
on the newsgroup to a question from S. John Ross, is included
principally to show a way of changing the state of an object (the sword)
and of reporting that change in certain conditions &ndash; namely, if the
player is carrying the sword. The idea that the sword glows if the
lurking critter is nearby is borrowed from Zork.</p>

<p>We’ll start by creating a checkerboard-like matrix of 16 rooms. This
matrix is at least mildly interesting in that the room connections cross
one another without intersecting. That is, you can go southeast from
Room1 to Room6, or southwest from Room2 to Room5, but the two paths are
independent. (Maybe there are arched stone bridges.) Both the player and
the lurking critter can move diagonally from room to room as well as
orthogonally. The critter will move at random, but only 50% of the
time.</p>

<h3 id="restraints">Restraints</h3>

<p>Preventing the player from performing certain actions in certain
situations is a standard type of puzzle. For instance, if the player is
wearing handcuffs, picking things up (that is, using the TAKE or GET
command) probably shouldn’t work. I’ll leave it up to your imagination
to figure out how the player character might be able to remove a pair of
handcuffs while unable to pick up the key. In the example below, a
simple workaround is used &ndash; the player is allowed to pick up the key,
but nothing else.</p>

<p><a href="https://intfiction.org/t/action-names/678">The Restraints example was posted by Zeborah on the forum at
intfiction.org</a> and then revised by me with a little help from Mike
Tarbert, provides a general-purpose way to intercept actions depending
on what sort of restraint the PC is wearing. It uses a table to
correlate actions with restraints.</p>

<p>This example takes advantage of the fact that when the Inform
compiler builds rulebooks, it lists more specific rules ahead of more
general rules. The Instead rules for the tool chest, key, and handcuffs
will be listed before the general-purpose Instead rule, so they’ll allow
the player to solve the puzzle by opening the chest, picking up the key,
and then unlocking the handcuffs.</p>

<p>The example also shows how to use a table containing list entries,
and how to use the phrase “action-name part of the current action,”
which is not a syntax mentioned elsewhere in this <em>Handbook</em>
(nor, for that matter, in <em>Writing with Inform</em>). It’s a useful
syntax to know. For instance, if the current action is “going north”,
the action-name part of the action is “going”.</p>

<p>After removing the handcuffs, you can experiment further with this
example by wearing the blindfold and trying to examine things, or by
adding an NPC, wearing the gag, and then trying to talk to the NPC.</p>

<h3 id="broken-eggs">Broken Eggs</h3>

<p>This next example was originally written by Jason Travis and posted
in the newsgroup, in response to a question from Rob Cowell about how to
break a box full of eggs when the box was dropped. I’ve expanded the
example quite a bit. It shows how to handle a collection of
indistinguishable objects (the eggs) when any individual egg can be
either broken or unbroken.</p>

<p>First, we’ll set up the game and let Inform know that an egg is a
kind of thing. We’ll add some code that will allow eggs to be broken or
unbroken. Note the use of a couple of “before printing” rules to let the
player know what sort of egg is being mentioned. This is a handy
alternative to changing the printed name of an egg object when the egg
itself is in the process of getting broken.</p>

</div>

<p>We don’t want the player carrying around broken eggs, so we’ll get
rid of them if the player tries to take them. This next bit of code
illustrates the use of the word “called” to create a reference (BE) that
we can use while writing the Instead rule. In this case, we could just
as easily skip the “called” reference and say “remove the noun from
play”, but “called” is a handy bit of syntax to know, so we’ll use it
here.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Instead of taking a broken egg (called BE): \n\tsay &quot;You spend a good deal of time cleaning it up, throwing the gooey \ndebris into the trash.&quot;; \n\tremove BE from play. \n`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline">Instead of taking a broken egg (called BE): </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;remove BE from play. </div>
</div>

<p>Next, we need a box with some eggs in it. Note the use of the text
substitution “[box-contents]”. This lets us write a whole To say rule
that will mention the eggs in the box if there are any. By default,
Inform doesn’t list the contents of an open container when the container
is examined. But since broken eggs are highly noticeable, we’ll tack a
list of things in the eggbox onto the description. The carry out rule
for examining the eggbox causes Inform not to print out an extra line
repeating the contents of the box. This is not strictly necessary; we
could let Inform do this for us. But it would make the list of contents
into a separate paragraph. The code below tucks the list of contents
neatly into the end of the main paragraph.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The eggbox is a closed openable container in Kitchen.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say ". In the box you can see [a list of things in the eggbox]".</div>
</div>

<p>Now it’s time to break some eggs. The first part is easy. If the
player uses the command DROP EGG, something bad will happen. We’ll break
the egg in an After rule because we want to make sure the dropping
action has been successfully carried out. If we used an Instead rule,
we’d have to move the broken egg to the floor of the room manually,
because the Instead rule would bypass Inform’s normal handling of the
DROP action. We’d also have to make sure the player was actually
carrying the egg, for the same reason. With an After rule, our code can
be simpler and less error-prone.</p>

<p>The consequences of dropping the eggbox are more complicated. We’re
going to assume that if the eggbox is closed, the eggs in it won’t break
when the box is dropped. (Kids &ndash; don’t try this at home!) If the box is
open, the eggs in it will break. But what if the box contains both some
broken eggs and some unbroken ones? That could happen, for instance, if
the player uses the commands OPEN BOX, TAKE EGG, DROP BOX, PUT EGG IN
BOX, TAKE BOX. At this point the box would contain (probably) some
broken eggs and an unbroken one.</p>

</div>

<p>Studying this After rule may help you see how to structure blocks of
code. The outermost if-test is “if the eggbox is closed … otherwise”.
Within each of these blocks, we test whether the eggbox does not contain
an egg, and deal with that possibility. And so on.</p>

<p>The use of “[run paragraph on]” and “let N be the number&hellip;” is also
worth a quick look, if you’re not familiar with these tools.</p>

<h3 id="indoors-outdoors">Indoors &amp; Outdoors</h3>

<p>Inform’s built-in library creates rooms in a basic way. They have no
walls, floor, or ceiling. If outdoors, they have no ground or sky. Such
objects can easily be created as backdrops. A more serious limitation is
that even outdoor rooms are, by default, “sealed containers.” You can’t
look from one outdoor room into another and see anything that’s
there.</p>

<p>My first thought was to bundle the example game below as an
extension, in order to provide these features and a few others for
anyone who might find them useful. But I suspect authors will almost
always want to customize the implementation in various ways. Since none
of the code in the example game is tucked away in an extension, you can
easily copy it into your own game and modify it as needed.</p>

<p>If you want to write a realistic outdoor setting, spend some time
studying <a href="../RB_3.html#section_p">RB 3.4: Continuous Spaces and the
Outdoors</a>. The examples in that section
illustrate some useful techniques. For the present example, we’re going
to implement both outdoor and indoor rooms. We’ll start by creating some
backdrops and a couple of kinds of room. (Note that to use this code,
you will usually need to add a few extra words to each of your existing
room definitions, to tell Inform whether the new room is an indoor room
or an outdoor room.)</p>

<p>We need a special “check taking” rule for the sky, because by default
Inform will respond to the player’s attempt to take a backdrop by saying
“That’s hardly portable.” This response works fine for walls, floor,
ceiling, and ground, but not for the sky.</p>

<p>Defining some of the directions as diagonal will become important if
the player tries LOOK NORTHEAST, for instance, while indoors. We want to
refer to the corner of the room, not to a wall (since most likely there
will be two walls meeting in the northeast). Having taken care of that
detail, we create a pair of regions, in order to put the backdrops in
them.</p>

<p>A limitation of Inform, which may come into play if you try adapting
the code in this example for use in your game, is that regions can’t
overlap. (The basic way of handling region definitions is explained in <a href="#regions">Regions</a>.) Because of this limitation, if you use
the code below you won’t be able to include both an indoor room and an
outdoor room in any of the regions you might want to define in your
game. Indoor rooms are in the Great Indoors region and outdoor rooms in
the Great Outdoors region.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll add some code to let the player use commands of the form
LOOK EAST. This type of command will do one thing if the player is in an
indoor room (it will examine a wall) and another if the player is in an
outdoor room (it will use the new direction-looking action that we’re
about to define).</p>

<p>The code above uses a list (a global variable) called the huge-list,
which we’ll create in the next section. The huge-list is not a permanent
thing; we’ll assemble it dynamically each time it needs to be used.
We’ll do this by checking for huge things. A huge thing, as you might
imagine, is something that’s big enough to see from a distance when
outdoors. Nothing in the game will be huge unless the author says it
is.</p>

<p>Things that are huge will need to be added to scope in every turn
when the player is in an outdoor room. This will assure that the player
can refer to them in commands.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll implement floorless rooms (more or less in the manner
discussed in <a href="#floorless-rooms">Floorless Rooms</a>). The reason for
including floorless rooms in the example will become apparent in a
moment.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`Limbo is a room.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the noun to DZ;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say "[The noun] plummets down out of sight."</div>
</div>

<p>The final facet of this example is to let the player throw things
from one room into another (but only when outdoors). First we’ll add a
few more vocabulary words as synonyms for “drop”. We really only want
these words to be used in the new direction-throwing action, but if we
don’t add them to the drop action, Inform will respond to the command
TOSS THE BALL by saying “What do you want to toss the ball?” This would
be ugly.</p>

<p>Note also that if there’s any reason in the game why the player won’t
be allowed to drop things &ndash; such as being tied up &ndash; the game’s code will
need to prevent direction-throwing in that circumstance as well. If you
omit this step, the player will have an unintended way to drop things,
by typing something like THROW RABID GERBIL EAST.</p>

<p>If the direction-throwing action hasn’t been stopped by the check
rule, we know (a) that the player is carrying the noun, (b) that the
noun is small enough to throw, (c) that the player is outdoors, and (d)
that there is a room in that direction, to which the noun can be
thrown.</p>

<p>The carry out rule, below, moves the thrown object off into whatever
room exists in the direction the player has thrown the object &ndash; unless
the room in that direction is floorless. If the destination is
floorless, the thrown object will instead end up in the drop zone of the
floorless room.</p>

<p>The report rule checks to see where the noun has landed. If the
player has tried to throw it up into a tree (a floorless room), it will
by this time have landed somewhere else. This would most likely be the
room the player is in (if she’s standing at the base of the tree) &ndash; but
that’s not guaranteed. The player could be out on the limb of a tree and
throw something south, toward the main part of the tree, thus causing it
to drop to the ground below.</p>

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any

exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">3. License Grant.</span> Subject to
the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:</p>

<p>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
Collections;</p>

<p>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";</p>

<p>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
in Collections; and,</p>

<p>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</p>

<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights
not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">4. Restrictions.</span> The license
granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:</p>

<p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.</p>

<p>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You
must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every
copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of
the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
Applicable License.</p>

<p>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.</p>

<p>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Non-waivable Compulsory License
Schemes</span>. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
License;</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Waivable Compulsory License
Schemes</span>. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect
royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and
otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
compulsory licensing scheme; and,</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Voluntary License Schemes</span>.
The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than
noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).</p>

<p>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
(right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer</span></p>

<p class="caps">Unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, licensor offers the work
as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
the work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, noninfringement, or the absence of latent or other
defects, accuracy, or the presence of absence of errors, whether or not
discoverable. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">6. Limitation on Liability.</span>
<span class="caps">Except to the extent required by applicable law, in no event will
licensor be liable to you on any legal theory for any special,
incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of
this license or the use of the work, even if licensor has been advised
of the possibility of such damages.</span></p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">7. Termination</span></p>

<p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.</p>

<p>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">8. Miscellaneous</span></p>

<p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
this License.</p>

<p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</p>

<p>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.</p>

<p>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</p>

<p>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>

<p>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
license of any rights under applicable law.</p>
