<h3 id="sample-games">Sample Games</h3>

<p>In this appendix you’ll find a few miniature games that illustrate
various techniques. These games are a bit too complex to fit well within
the main flow of the <em>Handbook,</em> so they’re gathered here instead, in no
particular order.</p>

<h3 id="flea-market">Flea Market</h3>

<p>We’ll start with a simple scenario that was suggested by Jay in a post
on the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction, back in the day when it was still
a go-to place for IF info. Jay’s goal was to make NPCs respond at random
to items carried by the player. Each time the player takes inventory,
one of the other shoppers in the flea market will notice some random
thing the player carries, and comment on it.</p>

<p>This example illustrates four techniques: calling a function, creating a
definition, using what computer programmers call a <em>switch</em> statement,
and using a while loop.</p>

<p>Inform’s switch statement (see <a href="../WI_11.html#section_8">WI 11.8:
Otherwise</a>) <span id="Ref_switch_statement" class="anchor"></span>uses a double hyphen to indicate the various entries in
the switch block. Only one of the lines in a switch block will be run at
any given time. (A note to programmers: Inform doesn’t require break
statements in switch statements.) In this case, we enter the switch
block by selecting a random number between 1 and 5 and then choosing a
say statement based on the value of the random number.</p>

<p>We’re creating a function (“To say the desire”) and passing it two
arguments – a person and a thing. Within the function, we refer to the
person as P and the thing as J. There’s nothing special about these
symbols; we could just as easily have written “To say the desire of
(dude - a person) for (stuff - a thing)” and then referred to “[dude]”
and “[stuff]” in the say statements.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tif a random number from 1 to 5 is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been looking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot; \n\nAfter taking inventory: \n\tif nothing is held by the player or the player is alone: \n\t	rule succeeds; \n\totherwise: \n\t	let shopper be the player; \n\t	while shopper is the player: \n\t		let shopper be a random person in the location; \n\t	let junk be a random thing held by the player; \n\t	say &quot;[the desire of shopper for junk]&quot;. \n\nDefinition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1.`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>

<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking inventory: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if nothing is held by the player or the player is alone: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let shopper be the player; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while shopper is the player: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let shopper be a random person in the location; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let junk be a random thing held by the player; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[the desire of shopper for junk]&quot;. </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1.</div>
</div>
<p>The After rule causes nothing to happen if the player is alone or is
carrying nothing. Before entering the while statement in the After rule,
we define a variable called shopper, and give it the value of the
player. When the while statement starts, shopper is the player. The
while statement is a loop. It will execute over and over, randomly
picking one person after another in the location, until the person it
picks is <em>not</em> the player. This is what we want; if the shopper is still
the player, the output of the switch statement will be something like,
“yourself edges closer to you and says wistfully…”. Once the shopper is
not yourself, the condition (while shopper is the player) becomes false,
the loop ends, and the rest of the After rule runs. The rule chooses a
random thing held by the player, combines it with the randomly chosen
NPC, and says the desire of the random person for the random thing.</p>

<p>The definition is simple: We need to tell Inform what we mean by
“alone,” because the “After taking inventory” rule needs to check this.
Can you see what will happen if the “After taking inventory” rule
doesn’t include the condition “if … the player is alone”? If the player
ever takes inventory when no one else is in the location, the rule will
go into an endless loop. The while statement will keep trying forever to
find an NPC in the location, but it will always end up choosing the
player.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the game:</p>

</div>
<p>Since we don’t know what the player may be carrying or who may be in the
location, we pretty much have to choose NPCs and held items at random.
However, when items are selected at random, Inform will sometimes select
the same item several times in a row. This can result in a repeating
output, which will make the game seem wooden – but in a real game there
might be only one NPC in the location, or the player might be carrying
only one item, so repetition is not avoidable. If you’d prefer to
minimize the repetition, you can at least step through the list of
entries in the “To say the desire” rule in a repeating order, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The desire-index is a number that varies. The desire-index is 0.\n\nTo say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tincrease the desire-index by 1;\n\tif the desire-index is greater than 5:\n\t	now the desire-index is 1;\n\tif the desire-index is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been \nlooking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot;`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>
<div class="codeline">The desire-index is a number that varies. The desire-index is 0.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the desire-index by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the desire-index is greater than 5:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the desire-index is 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the desire-index is: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot;</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we’ve created a global variable (desire-index). It’s global so
that it will persist throughout the game; a local variable within a rule
will be destroyed when the rule finishes. We then increase the
desire-index by 1 each time the rule runs and check to see if it has
gone past 5. If so, we reset it to 1. Now the five statements will be
used in the order shown, over and over (but with random people and
random things).</p>

<h3 id="mr-potato-head">Mr Potato Head</h3>

<p>The next example game illustrates several useful points. First, it shows
how to make parts that can be attached to or detached from an object.
(In this case, the object is the ever-obliging Mr Potato Head.)</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Potato Factory is a room.\n\nMr Potato Head is a man in the Factory. The description is &quot;Mr Potato head is big and round and brown[attachment-list].&quot;\n\nTo say attachment-list: \n\tlet count be 0; \n\trepeat with item running through things that are a part of Mr Potato Head:\n\t	increase count by 1; \n\tif count is 0: \n\t	do nothing; \n\totherwise: \n\t	if the lips are part of Mr Potato Head:\n\t		increase count by 1;\n\t	say &quot;.

<div class="codeline">The Potato Factory is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Mr Potato Head is a man in the Factory. The description is &quot;Mr Potato head is big and round and brown[attachment-list].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say attachment-list: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let count be 0; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through things that are a part of Mr Potato Head:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase count by 1; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if count is 0: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the lips are part of Mr Potato Head:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase count by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;. Adding an attractive facial character to Mr Potato Head [if count is greater than 1]are[otherwise]is[end if] [a list of things that are part of Mr Potato Head]&quot;.</div>
</div>
<p>The point of the “say attachment-list” code is that we want to append a
list of Mr Potato Head’s features to his description. Just to make
things slightly more interesting, the lips are plural-named, so if the
lips are part of Mr Potato Head we need to increase the count by 1 in
order to print out “are” rather than “is” if the lips are the only
feature that has been attached.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll create some facial attachments, and also an irrelevant item
(the banana) for testing purposes.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A facial attachment is a kind of thing. The nose is a facial attachment.

</div>
<p>In creating our new detaching it from action, we also need to consider
that the player’s most likely command is simply TAKE NOSE. The parser’s
default response would be, “That seems to be a part of Mr Potato Head.”
Inform very sensibly doesn’t let the player go around removing the parts
of things. So we need another Instead rule to map TAKE NOSE onto the
detaching it from action.</p>

  <h3 id="a-dangerous-jewel-box">A Dangerous Jewel Box</h3>

  <p>The next example shows a way of printing out a single message when the
player tries to take several items and is prevented from doing so. There
are three jewels in the jewel box, and if the box is in its dangerous
state, we want the player character’s fingers to be zapped by an
electric shock if he tries to get the jewels from the box. But what we
don’t want is an output that looks like this:</p>

  <div class="game-output">
    <div class="command">
      <p><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take jewels</p>
    </div>
    <p>ruby: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

    <p>diamond: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

    <p>sapphire: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This would be silly, because the player character would naturally stop
after being shocked the first time. Getting the output to read nicely
turns out to be complicated, because there are many possible conditions
that might occur in the game. The box might be safe rather than
dangerous (this is handled in the example with the command TURN
CARVING). The player might make the box safe, take two jewels, drop them
on the floor, make the box dangerous again, and then try TAKE JEWELS.
What should happen then?</p>

  <p>The extension <a href="https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/master/John%20Clemens/Consolidated%20Multiple%20Actions.i7x">Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens</a>, which
was recently updated by Emily Short for 6L38 compatibility, can handle
this type of scenario – but it only works in Glulx games. If you don’t
need or want all of its functionality, studying the code below will show
you how to handle this type of situation.</p>

  <p>The heavy lifting is done by the “Before taking gems” rule. Note that if
one or more gems are available for taking, this rule has to handle the
process manually. It can’t include, near the end, the line “try taking
item”, because that will cause Inform to try running the entire rule
again. It will produce a loop, which will result in a run-time error.</p>

  <h3 id="the-omega-machine">The Omega Machine</h3>

  <p>This sophisticated example showed up back in 2009 on the IntFiction
forum. The author, who goes by the handle SJ_43, was responding to <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/i7-giving-orders-to-a-device-format-is-name-order/677">a
question from someone named Eudoxia about how to make a device that the
player can give commands to</a> – for instance, a command like COMPUTER,
CHECK THE STABILIZERS. The game below doesn’t implement anything quite
that complicated, but it provides a framework with which you could
easily do it. The sneaky Inform 6 trick in this code is the line,
“Include (- has talkable, -) when defining a computer.” The parentheses
and dashes are used (as described in <a href="#what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What Does Inform 6 Have to Do with
Inform 7</a>) to drop the
code out of I7 and down into I6. “has talkable” is I6 code that means,
more or less, “This is an object the player may want to be able to talk
to.”</p>

  <p>Note that the Default Messages extension may change or not be compatible
with a future version of Inform 7. It’s used here to create a special
error message for devices of the computer kind.</p>

  <p>I’ve customized SJ_43’s code by adding some calendar messages for
Omega. In a real game, you’d probably want to store such messages in a
table, so as to be able to refer to different messages at different
points in the game.</p>

  <h3 id="the-lurking-critter">The Lurking Critter</h3>

  <p>This example, which was inspired by an answer that Mike Gentry gave on
the newsgroup to a question from S. John Ross, is included principally
to show a way of changing the state of an object (the sword) and of
reporting that change in certain conditions – namely, if the player is
carrying the sword. The idea that the sword glows if the lurking critter
is nearby is borrowed from Zork.</p>

  <p>We’ll start by creating a checkerboard-like matrix of 16 rooms. This
matrix is at least mildly interesting in that the room connections cross
one another without intersecting. That is, you can go southeast from
Room1 to Room6, or southwest from Room2 to Room5, but the two paths are
independent. (Maybe there are arched stone bridges.) Both the player and
the lurking critter can move diagonally from room to room as well as

  <h3 id="restraints">Restraints</h3>

  <p>Preventing the player from performing certain actions in certain
situations is a standard type of puzzle. For instance, if the player is
wearing handcuffs, picking things up (that is, using the TAKE or GET
command) probably shouldn’t work. I’ll leave it up to your imagination
to figure out how the player character might be able to remove a pair of
handcuffs while unable to pick up the key. In the example below, a
simple workaround is used – the player is allowed to pick up the key,
but nothing else.</p>

  <p><a href="https://intfiction.org/t/action-names/678">The Restraints example was posted by Zeborah on IntFiction</a> and then
revised by me with a little help from Mike Tarbert, provides a
general-purpose way to intercept actions depending on what sort of
restraint the PC is wearing. It uses a table to correlate actions with
restraints.</p>

  <p>This example takes advantage of the fact that when the Inform compiler
builds rulebooks, it lists more specific rules ahead of more general
rules. The Instead rules for the tool chest, key, and handcuffs will be
listed before the general-purpose Instead rule, so they’ll allow the
player to solve the puzzle by opening the chest, picking up the key, and
then unlocking the handcuffs.</p>

  <p>The example also shows how to use a table containing list entries, and
how to use the phrase “action-name part of the current action,” which is
not a syntax mentioned elsewhere in this <em>Handbook</em> (nor, for that
matter, in <em>Writing with Inform</em>). It’s a useful syntax to know. For
instance, if the current action is “going north”, the action-name part
of the action is “going”.</p>

  <p>After removing the handcuffs, you can experiment further with this
example by wearing the blindfold and trying to examine things, or by
adding an NPC, wearing the gag, and then trying to talk to the NPC.</p>

  <p>This next example was originally written by Jason Travis and posted in

break a box full of eggs when the box was dropped. I’ve expanded the
example quite a bit. It shows how to handle a collection of
indistinguishable objects (the eggs) when any individual egg can be
either broken or unbroken.</p>

  <p>First, we’ll set up the game and let Inform know that an egg is a kind
of thing. We’ll add some code that will allow eggs to be broken or
unbroken. Note the use of a couple of “before printing” rules to let the
player know what sort of egg is being mentioned. This is a handy
alternative to changing the printed name of an egg object when the egg
itself is in the process of getting broken.</p>

  <p>We don’t want the player carrying around broken eggs, so we’ll get rid
of them if the player tries to take them. This next bit of code
illustrates the use of the word “called” to create a reference (BE) that
we can use while writing the Instead rule. In this case, we could just
as easily skip the “called” reference and say “remove the noun from
play”, but “called” is a handy bit of syntax to know, so we’ll use it
here.</p>

  <p>Next, we need a box with some eggs in it. Note the use of the text
substitution “[box-contents]”. This lets us write a whole To say rule
that will mention the eggs in the box if there are any. By default,
Inform doesn’t list the contents of an open container when the container
is examined. But since broken eggs are highly noticeable, we’ll tack a
list of things in the eggbox onto the description. The carry out rule
for examining the eggbox causes Inform not to print out an extra line
repeating the contents of the box. This is not strictly necessary; we
could let Inform do this for us. But it would make the list of contents
into a separate paragraph. The code below tucks the list of contents
neatly into the end of the main paragraph.</p>

  <p>Now it’s time to break some eggs. The first part is easy. If the player
uses the command DROP EGG, something bad will happen. We’ll break the
egg in an After rule because we want to make sure the dropping action
has been successfully carried out. If we used an Instead rule, we’d have
to move the broken egg to the floor of the room manually, because the
Instead rule would bypass Inform’s normal handling of the DROP action.
We’d also have to make sure the player was actually carrying the egg,
for the same reason. With an After rule, our code can be simpler and
less error-prone.</p>

  <p>The consequences of dropping the eggbox are more complicated. We’re
going to assume that if the eggbox is closed, the eggs in it won’t break
when the box is dropped. (Kids – don’t try this at home!) If the box is
open, the eggs in it will break. But what if the box contains both some
broken eggs and some unbroken ones? That could happen, for instance, if
the player uses the commands OPEN BOX, TAKE EGG, DROP BOX, PUT EGG IN
BOX, TAKE BOX. At this point the box would contain (probably) some
broken eggs and an unbroken one.</p>

  <p>Studying this After rule may help you see how to structure blocks of
code. The outermost if-test is “if the eggbox is closed … otherwise”.
Within each of these blocks, we test whether the eggbox does not contain
an egg, and deal with that possibility. And so on.</p>

  <p>The use of “[run paragraph on]” and “let N be the number…” is also
worth a quick look, if you’re not familiar with these tools.</p>

  <h3 id="indoors-outdoors">Indoors &amp; Outdoors</h3>

  <p>Inform’s built-in library creates rooms in a basic way. They have no
walls, floor, or ceiling. If outdoors, they have no ground or sky. Such
objects can easily be created as backdrops. A more serious limitation is
that even outdoor rooms are, by default, “sealed containers.” You can’t
look from one outdoor room into another and see anything that’s there.</p>

  <p>My first thought was to bundle the example game below as an extension,
in order to provide these features and a few others for anyone who might
find them useful. But I suspect authors will almost always want to
customize the implementation in various ways. Since none of the code in
the example game is tucked away in an extension, you can easily copy it
into your own game and modify it as needed.</p>

  <p>If you want to write a realistic outdoor setting, spend some time
studying <a href="../RB_3.html#section_p">RB 3.4: Continuous Spaces and the
Outdoors</a>. The examples in that section
illustrate some useful techniques. For the present example, we’re going
to implement both outdoor and indoor rooms. We’ll start by creating some
backdrops and a couple of kinds of room. (Note that to use this code,
you will usually need to add a few extra words to each of your existing
room definitions, to tell Inform whether the new room is an indoor room
or an outdoor room.)</p>

  <p>We need a special “check taking” rule for the sky, because by default
Inform will respond to the player’s attempt to take a backdrop by saying
“That’s hardly portable.” This response works fine for walls, floor,
ceiling, and ground, but not for the sky.</p>

  <p>Defining some of the directions as diagonal will become important if the
player tries LOOK NORTHEAST, for instance, while indoors. We want to
refer to the corner of the room, not to a wall (since most likely there
will be two walls meeting in the northeast). Having taken care of that
detail, we create a pair of regions, in order to put the backdrops in
them.</p>

  <p>A limitation of Inform, which may come into play if you try adapting the
code in this example for use in your game, is that regions can’t
overlap. (The basic way of handling region definitions is explained in
<a href="#regions">Regions</a>.) Because of this limitation, if you use the code

rooms are in the Great Indoors region and outdoor rooms in the Great

  <p>The code above uses a list (a global variable) called the huge-list,
which we’ll create in the next section. The huge-list is not a permanent
thing; we’ll assemble it dynamically each time it needs to be used.
We’ll do this by checking for huge things. A huge thing, as you might
imagine, is something that’s big enough to see from a distance when
outdoors. Nothing in the game will be huge unless the author says it is.</p>

  <p>Things that are huge will need to be added to scope in every turn when
the player is in an outdoor room. This will assure that the player can
refer to them in commands.</p>

  <p>The final facet of this example is to let the player throw things from
one room into another (but only when outdoors). First we’ll add a few
more vocabulary words as synonyms for “drop”. We really only want these
words to be used in the new direction-throwing action, but if we don’t
add them to the drop action, Inform will respond to the command TOSS THE
BALL by saying “What do you want to toss the ball?” This would be ugly.</p>

  <p>Note also that if there’s any reason in the game why the player won’t be
allowed to drop things – such as being tied up – the game’s code will
need to prevent direction-throwing in that circumstance as well. If you
omit this step, the player will have an unintended way to drop things,
by typing something like THROW RABID GERBIL EAST.</p>

    <div class="codeline">
      <p>         try dropping the noun instead.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If the direction-throwing action hasn’t been stopped by the check rule,
we know (a) that the player is carrying the noun, (b) that the noun is
small enough to throw, (c) that the player is outdoors, and (d) that
there is a room in that direction, to which the noun can be thrown.</p>

  <p>The carry out rule, below, moves the thrown object off into whatever
room exists in the direction the player has thrown the object – unless
the room in that direction is floorless. If the destination is
floorless, the thrown object will instead end up in the drop zone of the
floorless room.</p>

  <p>The report rule checks to see where the noun has landed. If the player
has tried to throw it up into a tree (a floorless room), it will by this
time have landed somewhere else. This would most likely be the room the
player is in (if she’s standing at the base of the tree) – but that’s
not guaranteed. The player could be out on the limb of a tree and throw
something south, toward the main part of the tree, thus causing it to
drop to the ground below.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-c-short-sample-games">Appendix C: Short Sample Games</h2>

<h3 id="sample-games">Sample Games</h3>

<p>In this appendix you’ll find a few miniature games that illustrate
various techniques. These games are a bit too complex to fit well within
the main flow of the <em>Handbook,</em> so they’re gathered here instead, in no
particular order.</p>

<h3 id="flea-market">Flea Market</h3>

<p>We’ll start with a simple scenario that was suggested by Jay in a post
on the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction, back in the day when it was still
a go-to place for IF info. Jay’s goal was to make NPCs respond at random
to items carried by the player. Each time the player takes inventory,
one of the other shoppers in the flea market will notice some random
thing the player carries, and comment on it.</p>

<p>This example illustrates four techniques: calling a function, creating a
definition, using what computer programmers call a <em>switch</em> statement,
and using a while loop.</p>

<p>Inform’s switch statement (see <a href="../WI_11.html#section_8">WI 11.8:
Otherwise</a>) <span id="Ref_switch_statement" class="anchor"></span>uses a double hyphen to indicate the various entries in
the switch block. Only one of the lines in a switch block will be run at
any given time. (A note to programmers: Inform doesn’t require break
statements in switch statements.) In this case, we enter the switch
block by selecting a random number between 1 and 5 and then choosing a
say statement based on the value of the random number.</p>

<p>We’re creating a function (“To say the desire”) and passing it two
arguments – a person and a thing. Within the function, we refer to the
person as P and the thing as J. There’s nothing special about these
symbols; we could just as easily have written “To say the desire of
(dude - a person) for (stuff - a thing)” and then referred to “[dude]”
and “[stuff]” in the say statements.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tif a random number from 1 to 5 is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been looking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot; \n\nAfter taking inventory: \n\tif nothing is held by the player or the player is alone: \n\t	rule succeeds; \n\totherwise: \n\t	let shopper be the player; \n\t	while shopper is the player: \n\t		let shopper be a random person in the location; \n\t	let junk be a random thing held by the player; \n\t	say &quot;[the desire of shopper for junk]&quot;. \n\nDefinition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1.`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>
<div class="codeline">To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot; </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After taking inventory: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if nothing is held by the player or the player is alone: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let shopper be the player; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while shopper is the player: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let shopper be a random person in the location; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let junk be a random thing held by the player; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[the desire of shopper for junk]&quot;. </div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a person (called P) is alone if the number of persons in the location of P is 1.</div>
</div>
<p>The After rule causes nothing to happen if the player is alone or is
carrying nothing. Before entering the while statement in the After rule,
we define a variable called shopper, and give it the value of the
player. When the while statement starts, shopper is the player. The
while statement is a loop. It will execute over and over, randomly
picking one person after another in the location, until the person it
picks is <em>not</em> the player. This is what we want; if the shopper is still
the player, the output of the switch statement will be something like,
“yourself edges closer to you and says wistfully…”. Once the shopper is
not yourself, the condition (while shopper is the player) becomes false,
the loop ends, and the rest of the After rule runs. The rule chooses a
random thing held by the player, combines it with the randomly chosen
NPC, and says the desire of the random person for the random thing.</p>

<p>The definition is simple: We need to tell Inform what we mean by
“alone,” because the “After taking inventory” rule needs to check this.
Can you see what will happen if the “After taking inventory” rule
doesn’t include the condition “if … the player is alone”? If the player
ever takes inventory when no one else is in the location, the rule will
go into an endless loop. The while statement will keep trying forever to
find an NPC in the location, but it will always end up choosing the
player.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the game:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Flea Market is a room. &quot;All manner of things are for sale here, lined up in rows on folding tables.&quot; \n\nA folding table is a supporter in the Flea Market.

</div>
<p>Since we don’t know what the player may be carrying or who may be in the
location, we pretty much have to choose NPCs and held items at random.
However, when items are selected at random, Inform will sometimes select
the same item several times in a row. This can result in a repeating
output, which will make the game seem wooden – but in a real game there
might be only one NPC in the location, or the player might be carrying
only one item, so repetition is not avoidable. If you’d prefer to
minimize the repetition, you can at least step through the list of
entries in the “To say the desire” rule in a repeating order, like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The desire-index is a number that varies. The desire-index is 0.\n\nTo say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): \n\tincrease the desire-index by 1;\n\tif the desire-index is greater than 5:\n\t	now the desire-index is 1;\n\tif the desire-index is: \n\t-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; \n\t-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; \n\t-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been \nlooking for years for a [J].&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 4: say &quot;[P] hovers over you covetously. &apos;Say, were there more [J]s where you found that?&apos;&quot;; \n\t-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot;`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button>
<div class="codeline">The desire-index is a number that varies. The desire-index is 0.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say the desire of (P - a person) for (J - a thing): </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the desire-index by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the desire-index is greater than 5:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the desire-index is 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the desire-index is: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 1: say &quot;&apos;Gee, I&apos;d sure like to have a [J] like that,&apos; [P] remarks.&quot;; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 2: say &quot;&apos;That&apos;s sure a swell-looking [J],&apos; says [P].&quot;; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 3: say &quot;[P] edges closer to you and says wistfully, &apos;I&apos;ve been </div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;-- 5: say &quot;&apos;Wow, that&apos;s a really nice [J],&apos; [P] says enviously.&quot;</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we’ve created a global variable (desire-index). It’s global so
that it will persist throughout the game; a local variable within a rule
will be destroyed when the rule finishes. We then increase the
desire-index by 1 each time the rule runs and check to see if it has
gone past 5. If so, we reset it to 1. Now the five statements will be
used in the order shown, over and over (but with random people and
random things).</p>

<h3 id="mr-potato-head">Mr Potato Head</h3>

<p>The next example game illustrates several useful points. First, it shows
how to make parts that can be attached to or detached from an object.
(In this case, the object is the ever-obliging Mr Potato Head.)</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Potato Factory is a room.\n\nMr Potato Head is a man in the Factory. The description is &quot;Mr Potato head is big and round and brown[attachment-list].&quot;\n\nTo say attachment-list: \n\tlet count be 0; \n\trepeat with item running through things that are a part of Mr Potato Head:\n\t	increase count by 1; \n\tif count is 0: \n\t	do nothing; \n\totherwise: \n\t	if the lips are part of Mr Potato Head:\n\t		increase count by 1;\n\t	say &quot;.

<div class="codeline">The Potato Factory is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Mr Potato Head is a man in the Factory. The description is &quot;Mr Potato head is big and round and brown[attachment-list].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say attachment-list: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let count be 0; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through things that are a part of Mr Potato Head:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase count by 1; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if count is 0: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing; </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise: </div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the lips are part of Mr Potato Head:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase count by 1;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;. Adding an attractive facial character to Mr Potato Head [if count is greater than 1]are[otherwise]is[end if] [a list of things that are part of Mr Potato Head]&quot;.</div>
</div>
<p>The point of the “say attachment-list” code is that we want to append a
list of Mr Potato Head’s features to his description. Just to make
things slightly more interesting, the lips are plural-named, so if the
lips are part of Mr Potato Head we need to increase the count by 1 in
order to print out “are” rather than “is” if the lips are the only
feature that has been attached.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll create some facial attachments, and also an irrelevant item
(the banana) for testing purposes.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`A facial attachment is a kind of thing. The nose is a facial attachment. The left eye is a facial attachment. The right eye is a facial attachment. Some lips are a facial attachment. \n\nThe player carries the nose. The player carries the left eye.

<p>In creating our new detaching it from action, we also need to consider
that the player’s most likely command is simply TAKE NOSE. The parser’s
default response would be, “That seems to be a part of Mr Potato Head.”
Inform very sensibly doesn’t let the player go around removing the parts
of things. So we need another Instead rule to map TAKE NOSE onto the
detaching it from action.</p>

  <h3 id="a-dangerous-jewel-box">A Dangerous Jewel Box</h3>

  <p>The next example shows a way of printing out a single message when the
player tries to take several items and is prevented from doing so. There
are three jewels in the jewel box, and if the box is in its dangerous
state, we want the player character’s fingers to be zapped by an
electric shock if he tries to get the jewels from the box. But what we
don’t want is an output that looks like this:</p>

  <div class="game-output">
    <div class="command">
      <p><span class="prompt">&gt;</span>take jewels</p>
    </div>
    <p>ruby: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

    <p>diamond: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

    <p>sapphire: Zap! As your fingers near the jewel box, you recoil from a
powerful electric shock.</p>

  </div>
  <p>This would be silly, because the player character would naturally stop
after being shocked the first time. Getting the output to read nicely
turns out to be complicated, because there are many possible conditions
that might occur in the game. The box might be safe rather than
dangerous (this is handled in the example with the command TURN
CARVING). The player might make the box safe, take two jewels, drop them
on the floor, make the box dangerous again, and then try TAKE JEWELS.
What should happen then?</p>

  <h3 id="the-omega-machine">The Omega Machine</h3>

  <p>This sophisticated example showed up back in 2009 on the IntFiction
forum. The author, who goes by the handle SJ_43, was responding to <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/i7-giving-orders-to-a-device-format-is-name-order/677">a
question from someone named Eudoxia about how to make a device that the
player can give commands to</a> – for instance, a command like COMPUTER,
CHECK THE STABILIZERS. The game below doesn’t implement anything quite
that complicated, but it provides a framework with which you could
easily do it. The sneaky Inform 6 trick in this code is the line,
“Include (- has talkable, -) when defining a computer.” The parentheses
and dashes are used (as described in <a href="#what-does-inform-6-have-to-do-with-inform-7">What Does Inform 6 Have to Do with
Inform 7</a>) to drop the
code out of I7 and down into I6. “has talkable” is I6 code that means,
more or less, “This is an object the player may want to be able to talk
to.”</p>

  <p>Note that the Default Messages extension may change or not be compatible
with a future version of Inform 7. It’s used here to create a special
error message for devices of the computer kind.</p>

  <p>I’ve customized SJ_43’s code by adding some calendar messages for
Omega. In a real game, you’d probably want to store such messages in a
table, so as to be able to refer to different messages at different

  <h3 id="the-lurking-critter">The Lurking Critter</h3>

  <p>This example, which was inspired by an answer that Mike Gentry gave on
the newsgroup to a question from S. John Ross, is included principally
to show a way of changing the state of an object (the sword) and of
reporting that change in certain conditions – namely, if the player is
carrying the sword. The idea that the sword glows if the lurking critter
is nearby is borrowed from Zork.</p>

  <p>We’ll start by creating a checkerboard-like matrix of 16 rooms. This
matrix is at least mildly interesting in that the room connections cross
one another without intersecting. That is, you can go southeast from
Room1 to Room6, or southwest from Room2 to Room5, but the two paths are
independent. (Maybe there are arched stone bridges.) Both the player and
the lurking critter can move diagonally from room to room as well as
orthogonally. The critter will move at random, but only 50% of the time.</p>

  <h3 id="restraints">Restraints</h3>

  <p>Preventing the player from performing certain actions in certain
situations is a standard type of puzzle. For instance, if the player is
wearing handcuffs, picking things up (that is, using the TAKE or GET
command) probably shouldn’t work. I’ll leave it up to your imagination
to figure out how the player character might be able to remove a pair of
handcuffs while unable to pick up the key. In the example below, a
simple workaround is used – the player is allowed to pick up the key,
but nothing else.</p>

  <p><a href="https://intfiction.org/t/action-names/678">The Restraints example was posted by Zeborah on IntFiction</a> and then
revised by me with a little help from Mike Tarbert, provides a
general-purpose way to intercept actions depending on what sort of
restraint the PC is wearing. It uses a table to correlate actions with
restraints.</p>

  <p>This example takes advantage of the fact that when the Inform compiler
builds rulebooks, it lists more specific rules ahead of more general
rules. The Instead rules for the tool chest, key, and handcuffs will be
listed before the general-purpose Instead rule, so they’ll allow the
player to solve the puzzle by opening the chest, picking up the key, and
then unlocking the handcuffs.</p>

  <p>The example also shows how to use a table containing list entries, and
how to use the phrase “action-name part of the current action,” which is
not a syntax mentioned elsewhere in this <em>Handbook</em> (nor, for that
matter, in <em>Writing with Inform</em>). It’s a useful syntax to know. For
instance, if the current action is “going north”, the action-name part
of the action is “going”.</p>

  <p>After removing the handcuffs, you can experiment further with this
example by wearing the blindfold and trying to examine things, or by
adding an NPC, wearing the gag, and then trying to talk to the NPC.</p>

  <h3 id="broken-eggs">Broken Eggs</h3>

  <p>This next example was originally written by Jason Travis and posted in
the newsgroup, in response to a question from Rob Cowell about how to
break a box full of eggs when the box was dropped. I’ve expanded the
example quite a bit. It shows how to handle a collection of
indistinguishable objects (the eggs) when any individual egg can be
either broken or unbroken.</p>

  <p>First, we’ll set up the game and let Inform know that an egg is a kind
of thing. We’ll add some code that will allow eggs to be broken or
unbroken. Note the use of a couple of “before printing” rules to let the
player know what sort of egg is being mentioned. This is a handy
alternative to changing the printed name of an egg object when the egg
itself is in the process of getting broken.</p>

  <p>We don’t want the player carrying around broken eggs, so we’ll get rid
of them if the player tries to take them. This next bit of code
illustrates the use of the word “called” to create a reference (BE) that
we can use while writing the Instead rule. In this case, we could just
as easily skip the “called” reference and say “remove the noun from
play”, but “called” is a handy bit of syntax to know, so we’ll use it
here.</p>

  <p>Next, we need a box with some eggs in it. Note the use of the text
substitution “[box-contents]”. This lets us write a whole To say rule
that will mention the eggs in the box if there are any. By default,
Inform doesn’t list the contents of an open container when the container
is examined. But since broken eggs are highly noticeable, we’ll tack a
list of things in the eggbox onto the description. The carry out rule
for examining the eggbox causes Inform not to print out an extra line
repeating the contents of the box. This is not strictly necessary; we
could let Inform do this for us. But it would make the list of contents
into a separate paragraph. The code below tucks the list of contents
neatly into the end of the main paragraph.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Now it’s time to break some eggs. The first part is easy. If the player
uses the command DROP EGG, something bad will happen. We’ll break the
egg in an After rule because we want to make sure the dropping action
has been successfully carried out. If we used an Instead rule, we’d have
to move the broken egg to the floor of the room manually, because the
Instead rule would bypass Inform’s normal handling of the DROP action.
We’d also have to make sure the player was actually carrying the egg,
for the same reason. With an After rule, our code can be simpler and
less error-prone.</p>

  <p>The consequences of dropping the eggbox are more complicated. We’re
going to assume that if the eggbox is closed, the eggs in it won’t break
when the box is dropped. (Kids – don’t try this at home!) If the box is
open, the eggs in it will break. But what if the box contains both some
broken eggs and some unbroken ones? That could happen, for instance, if
the player uses the commands OPEN BOX, TAKE EGG, DROP BOX, PUT EGG IN
BOX, TAKE BOX. At this point the box would contain (probably) some
broken eggs and an unbroken one.</p>

  <p>Studying this After rule may help you see how to structure blocks of
code. The outermost if-test is “if the eggbox is closed … otherwise”.
Within each of these blocks, we test whether the eggbox does not contain
an egg, and deal with that possibility. And so on.</p>

  <p>The use of “[run paragraph on]” and “let N be the number…” is also
worth a quick look, if you’re not familiar with these tools.</p>

  <h3 id="indoors-outdoors">Indoors &amp; Outdoors</h3>

  <p>Inform’s built-in library creates rooms in a basic way. They have no
walls, floor, or ceiling. If outdoors, they have no ground or sky. Such
objects can easily be created as backdrops. A more serious limitation is
that even outdoor rooms are, by default, “sealed containers.” You can’t
look from one outdoor room into another and see anything that’s there.</p>

  <p>My first thought was to bundle the example game below as an extension,
in order to provide these features and a few others for anyone who might
find them useful. But I suspect authors will almost always want to
customize the implementation in various ways. Since none of the code in
the example game is tucked away in an extension, you can easily copy it
into your own game and modify it as needed.</p>

  <p>If you want to write a realistic outdoor setting, spend some time
studying <a href="../RB_3.html#section_p">RB 3.4: Continuous Spaces and the
Outdoors</a>. The examples in that section
illustrate some useful techniques. For the present example, we’re going
to implement both outdoor and indoor rooms. We’ll start by creating some
backdrops and a couple of kinds of room. (Note that to use this code,
you will usually need to add a few extra words to each of your existing
room definitions, to tell Inform whether the new room is an indoor room
or an outdoor room.)</p>

  <p>We need a special “check taking” rule for the sky, because by default
Inform will respond to the player’s attempt to take a backdrop by saying
“That’s hardly portable.” This response works fine for walls, floor,

  <p>Defining some of the directions as diagonal will become important if the
player tries LOOK NORTHEAST, for instance, while indoors. We want to
refer to the corner of the room, not to a wall (since most likely there
will be two walls meeting in the northeast). Having taken care of that
detail, we create a pair of regions, in order to put the backdrops in
them.</p>

  <p>A limitation of Inform, which may come into play if you try adapting the
code in this example for use in your game, is that regions can’t
overlap. (The basic way of handling region definitions is explained in
<a href="#regions">Regions</a>.) Because of this limitation, if you use the code
below you won’t be able to include both an indoor room and an outdoor
room in any of the regions you might want to define in your game. Indoor
rooms are in the Great Indoors region and outdoor rooms in the Great
Outdoors region.</p>

  <p>Next, we’ll add some code to let the player use commands of the form
LOOK EAST. This type of command will do one thing if the player is in an
indoor room (it will examine a wall) and another if the player is in an
outdoor room (it will use the new direction-looking action that we’re
about to define).</p>

a message, but we need more nuance.</p>

  <p>The code above uses a list (a global variable) called the huge-list,
which we’ll create in the next section. The huge-list is not a permanent
thing; we’ll assemble it dynamically each time it needs to be used.
We’ll do this by checking for huge things. A huge thing, as you might
imagine, is something that’s big enough to see from a distance when
outdoors. Nothing in the game will be huge unless the author says it is.</p>

  <p>Things that are huge will need to be added to scope in every turn when
the player is in an outdoor room. This will assure that the player can
refer to them in commands.</p>

  <p>Next, we’ll implement floorless rooms (more or less in the manner
discussed in <a href="#floorless-rooms">Floorless Rooms</a>). The reason for
including floorless rooms in the example will become apparent in a
moment.</p>

  <div class="codeblock">

  <p>The final facet of this example is to let the player throw things from
one room into another (but only when outdoors). First we’ll add a few
more vocabulary words as synonyms for “drop”. We really only want these
words to be used in the new direction-throwing action, but if we don’t
add them to the drop action, Inform will respond to the command TOSS THE
BALL by saying “What do you want to toss the ball?” This would be ugly.</p>

  <p>Note also that if there’s any reason in the game why the player won’t be
allowed to drop things – such as being tied up – the game’s code will
need to prevent direction-throwing in that circumstance as well. If you
omit this step, the player will have an unintended way to drop things,
by typing something like THROW RABID GERBIL EAST.</p>

  <p>If the direction-throwing action hasn’t been stopped by the check rule,
we know (a) that the player is carrying the noun, (b) that the noun is
small enough to throw, (c) that the player is outdoors, and (d) that
there is a room in that direction, to which the noun can be thrown.</p>

  <p>The carry out rule, below, moves the thrown object off into whatever
room exists in the direction the player has thrown the object – unless
the room in that direction is floorless. If the destination is
floorless, the thrown object will instead end up in the drop zone of the
floorless room.</p>

  <p>The report rule checks to see where the noun has landed. If the player
has tried to throw it up into a tree (a floorless room), it will by this
time have landed somewhere else. This would most likely be the room the
player is in (if she’s standing at the base of the tree) – but that’s
not guaranteed. The player could be out on the limb of a tree and throw
something south, toward the main part of the tree, thus causing it to
drop to the ground below.</p>
