<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<p><strong>After:</strong> One of the rulebooks used in processing player commands. (See
<a href="#action-processing">Action Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>backdrop:</strong> A special kind of object that can be in many rooms at
once. (See <a href="#backdrops">Backdrops</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong> One of the rulebooks used in processing player commands.
(See <a href="#action-processing">Action Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>beta-testing:</strong> The second stage in testing a piece of software (such
as a game) before it’s released. (See <a href="#Ref_beta-test">Beta-test</a>.) The
first stage, alpha-testing, is typically carried out by the author or by
the development team.</p>

<p><strong>brief mode:</strong> A mode of gameplay in which complete room descriptions
are printed only the first time the player enters a room. (See <a href="#Ref_brief_mode">Brief
Mode</a>.) Brief mode is the opposite of verbose mode.</p>

<p><strong>bug:</strong> An error in your code that causes it not to work the way you
want it to, or not to compile at all. (See <a href="#all-about-bugs">All About
Bugs</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Carry Out:</strong> A set of rulebooks used in processing player commands.
Each action has its own Carry Out rulebook. (See <a href="#action-processing">Action
Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Check:</strong> A set of rulebooks used in processing player commands. Each
action has its own Check rulebook. (See <a href="#action-processing">Action
Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>command prompt:</strong> The symbol that appears in the game at the beginning
of the line where the player is supposed to type commands – usually the
caret (&gt;). (See <a href="#Ref_command_prompt">Command Prompt</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>comment:</strong> Material that’s in your source code but that is ignored by
the compiler. In Inform, comments are surrounded with square brackets
[like this].</p>

<p><strong>compiler:</strong> The software “machine” within Inform that turns your
source code into a playable game. (See <a href="#Ref_compiler">compiler</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>container:</strong> A thing that the player can put other things into. Like a
door, a container can be openable or lockable. (See <a href="#containers-supporters">Containers &amp;
Supporters</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>default:</strong> A default is what Inform does automatically, unless you
give it more specific instructions to do something different.</p>

<p><strong>device:</strong> A thing that can be switched on or switched off. (See
<a href="#Ref_device">device</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>door:</strong> A special kind of object that connects two rooms and that can
be opened, closed, locked, and unlocked.</p>

<p><strong>extension:</strong> A file you can download that will add extra features to
the Inform programming language. Extensions contain some Inform source
code and also some documentation that tells you how to use the new
features in the extension. (See <a href="#extensions-for-inform">Extensions for
Inform</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Glulx:</strong> A game format suitable for large Inform games and those that
include graphics and sound. Glulx games typically have filenames that
end with .ulx or .blorb.</p>

<p><strong>holdall:</strong> A special type of portable container that the player can
carry. If the player has a limited carrying capacity, an Inform game can
automatically deposit excess objects in the holdall. (See <a href="#Ref_holdall">player's
holdall</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>IDE:</strong> Integrated Development Environment. The Inform 7 authoring
system (which includes source code editing, built-in documentation, a
compiler, an interpreter, an index of the compiled game, and so on) is
an IDE.</p>

<p><strong>Index:</strong> A set of pages in the Inform program that give you quick
access to just about everything in your game.</p>

<p><strong>Instead:</strong> One of the rulebooks used in processing player commands.
(See <a href="#action-processing">Action Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>interpreter:</strong> A piece of software that can run an interactive fiction
game. (See p. <a href="#Ref_interpreter">Interpreter</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>kind:</strong> An abstract term used to create a class of similar things.
(See <a href="#Ref_kind">kind</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>noun:</strong> A special term that refers to whatever object the player
mentioned first in the most recent command. (See p. <a href="#Ref_noun">92</a>.)
For instance, if the player’s most recent command was PICK UP THE BALL,
the value “the noun” will be set to the ball object.</p>

<p><strong>NPC:</strong> Non-player character – any of the other people (or,
conceivably, talking animals) in a game other than the player character.</p>

<p><strong>parser:</strong> The software mechanism that reads the player’s input during
a game and figures out what the input means. (See
<a href="#Ref_parser">parser</a>.).</p>

<p><strong>PC:</strong> The player character in a game, typically referred to in the
game’s output text as “you.”</p>

<p><strong>printed name:</strong> The name Inform will use in the game when it needs to
refer to the object. Usually, the printed name is whatever you called
the object when creating it, but the printed name can be changed.</p>

<p><strong>property:</strong> A piece of data (such as text or a numeric value) that is
attached to an object. Each object can have its own set of properties,
and each property will be set to some particular value, either when the
object is created or during the course of the story. Typically, kinds of
object share many common properties.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe Book:</strong> The second book of Documentation in the Inform program.</p>

<p><strong>region:</strong> A related group of rooms within your model world. (See
<a href="#regions">Regions</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Report:</strong> A set of rulebooks used in processing player commands. Each
action has its own Report rulebook. (See <a href="#action-processing">Action
Processing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>room:</strong> A location (either indoors or outdoors) in which some part of
the game takes place. (See <a href="#creating-your-first-room">Creating Your First
Room</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>rule:</strong> An instruction that tells Inform what to do in a certain
situation. Rules are gathered together by the compiler into rulebooks.</p>

<p><strong>scene:</strong> A portion of your game that is structured so as to happen
during a certain period of time. (See <a href="#scenes">Scenes</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>scenery:</strong> A property that can be applied to things (including doors,
supporters, and so on). When a thing is scenery, it will not be
mentioned automatically in the game when the room description is
printed; your room description will need to supply all mentions of
scenery, so that the player will know the scenery object exists. Scenery
can’t be picked up and carried around by the player. (See
<a href="#scenery">Scenery</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>scope:</strong> The portion of the model world that is currently available to
the player. Usually the scope is the same as the room the player is in,
but in some special situations it may be different. (See
<a href="#Ref_scope">scope</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>second noun:</strong> A term that refers to the second object the player
mentioned in a two-object command. For instance, if the player’s most
recent command was PUT THE BALL IN THE BOX, the value “the second noun”
would refer to the box object.</p>

<p><strong>Skein:</strong> A panel in the Inform 7 IDE that keeps track of and can
replay all of your testing sessions with your project (or at least a
large number of recent sessions).</p>

<p><strong>source code:</strong> Also called source text – what you write in the Source
panel of Inform’s IDE.</p>

<p><strong>status line:</strong> The strip across the top of the window in a running
game. Various types of information, such as the room name, score, and
time of day within the game, can be displayed in the status line. (See
<a href="#Ref_status_line">status line</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>supporter:</strong> A kind of object in an Inform game. A supporter is an
object like a table, that other objects in the game can be placed <em>on</em>.
(See <a href="#containers-supporters">Containers &amp; Supporters</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>switch:</strong> A group of lines (see <a href="#Ref_switch_statement">switch
statement</a>) of code. Inform will choose one line
from the group depending on the current value of some variable.</p>

<p><strong>table:</strong> A data structure in which Inform can store related data in
rows and columns. (See <a href="#tables">Tables</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>thing:</strong> The basic kind of object in an Inform game. Doors,
supporters, containers, and even people are all things, but the term
“thing” is sometimes used to refer specifically to movable objects that
aren’t of any other kind.</p>

<p><strong>truth state:</strong> A kind of variable that can have only one of two values
– true or false. (See <a href="#Ref_truth_state">truth state</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>variable:</strong> A value that changes while the game is running. A variable
can be a number or an object, for example. (See
<a href="#Ref_variable">variable</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>verbose mode:</strong> A mode of gameplay in which complete room descriptions
are printed each time the player enters a room. (See <a href="#Ref_brief_mode">brief
mode</a>.) Verbose mode is the opposite of brief mode.</p>

<p><strong>virtual machine:</strong> A piece of software that creates a sort of “box”
inside which other software (such as an Inform game) can run. It’s
called a “virtual” machine because it isn’t an actual hardware machine.</p>

<p><strong>visible thing:</strong> An object that is somewhere in the model world of the
game, but not necessarily visible to the player at this moment. (See p.
<a href="#Ref_visible_thing">visible thing</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>wearable:</strong> A property of things. Wearable things can be worn by the
player, or by other characters.</p>

<p><strong>Z-code:</strong> A type of compiled game that is compatible with the
Z-machine. Inform can produce Z-code games in the .z8 format.</p>

<p><strong>Z-machine:</strong> An interpreter that can run games written in Inform.
(Large games and games with special features such as graphics are
written using Inform’s Glulx format, which is not compatible with the
Z-machine.) Z-machine interpreters are available for most computer
platforms, including many obsolete operating systems and some portable
devices.</p>
