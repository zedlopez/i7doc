<h3 id="section_1">RB §3.1 Room Descriptions</h3>
<div class="sect-navbar"><div class="sect-navbar-center"><a href="#chapter_3">3. Place</a></div><div class="sect-navbar-right"><a href="#section_2">3.2 Map</a></div></div>
<p>The printing of a room description is a more delicate business than it might initially seem to be: Inform has to consider all the objects that the player might have brought into the room or dropped there, and all the objects on visible supporters, and decide how to group and list them.</p>
<p>All of this behavior is handled by the looking command, so we find the relevant rules in the carry out looking rulebook. To go through the elements step by step:</p>
<p>Looking begins by printing the name and description of the room we&#39;re in. We can introduce variations into room names and descriptions by changing their printed name and description properties, as in</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">now the printed name of the Church is &quot;Lightning-Struck Ruin&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">now the description of the Church is &quot;The beams overhead have been burnt away and the pews are charred. Only the stone walls remain.&quot;;</div>
</div><p>If we need more drastic effects, we can turn off or change either of these features by altering the rules in the carry out looking rulebook. For instance, to remove the name of the location entirely from room descriptions, we would write</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The room description heading rule is not listed in the carry out looking rules.</div>
</div><p>(A word of warning: there is one other context in which the story prints a room name — when restoring a save or undoing a move. To omit the room title here too, add</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of a room: do nothing.)</div>
</div><p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/antsensitive_sunglasses.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_antsensitive_sunglasses').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="What are activities good for? Controlling output when we want the same action to be able to produce very flexible text depending on the state of the world -- in this case, making highly variable room description and object description text.">Ant-Sensitive Sunglasses</a></span> ★ demonstrates how to use activities to make more flexible room description text.</p>
<p>Next, the story determines what items are visible to the player and need to be described. These never include the player himself, or scenery, but other things in the environment will be made &quot;marked for listing&quot;. This is also the stage at which Inform chooses the order in which items will be listed.</p>
<p>We are allowed to meddle by changing the priorities of objects, in case we want some things to be described to the player first or last in the room description; <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/priority_lab.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_priority_lab').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A debugging rule useful for checking the priorities of objects about to be listed.">Priority Lab</a></span> ★ goes into detail about how. We can also force things to be left out entirely: <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/low_light.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_low_light').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An object that is only visible and manipulable when a bright light fixture is on.">Low Light</a></span> ★ handles the case of an object that can only be seen when an extra lamp is switched on, even though the room is not otherwise considered dark. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/copper_river.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_copper_river').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Manipulating room descriptions so that only interesting items are mentioned, while objects that are present but not currently useful to the player are ignored.">Copper River</a></span> ★★★ implements the idea of &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;dull&quot; objects: the story determines which items are currently important to the puzzles or narrative and mentions those in the room description, while suppressing everything else.</p>
<p>Then Inform carries out the writing a paragraph about&hellip; activity with anything that provides one; anything it prints the name of, it tags &quot;mentioned&quot;. Thus</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for writing a paragraph about Mr Wickham:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Mr Wickham looks speculatively at [list of women in the location].&quot;</div>
</div><p>will count Wickham and everyone he looks at as all having been mentioned, and will not refer to them again through the rest of the room description. More complicated uses of writing a paragraph abound. A developed system for handling supporters that don&#39;t list contents appears in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/eye_of_the_idol.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_eye_of_the_idol').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A systematic way to allow objects in certain places to be described in the room description body text rather than in paragraphs following the room description, and to control whether supporters list their contents or not.">The Eye of the Idol</a></span> ★★.</p>
<p>Inform then prints the initial appearances of objects that are marked for listing but not already mentioned; and then it performs the listing nondescript items activity, collating the remaining objects into a paragraph like</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">You can see a dog, a hen, ...</div>
</div><p>We can pre-empt items from appearing in this paragraph or change their listing by intervening with a Before listing nondescript items&hellip; rule, as in</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before listing nondescript items when the player needs the watch:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the watch is marked for listing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The watch catches your eye.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the watch is not marked for listing.</div>
</div><p>If we wanted the watch always to be listed this way, it would be better to give it an initial appearance, but for conditional cases, the listing nondescript items activity is a good place to intervene. For instance, <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/rip_van_winkle.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_rip_van_winkle').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A simple way to allow objects in certain places to be described in the room description body text rather than in paragraphs following the room description.">Rip</a></span> ★ uses this activity to incorporate changeable or portable items into the main description text for a room when (and only when) that is appropriate.</p>
<p>The listing nondescript items activity also allows us to replace the &quot;You can see&hellip;&quot; tag with something else more fitting, if for instance we are in a dimly lit room.</p>
<p>When the story compiles the list of nondescript items, it adds tags such as &quot;(open)&quot; or &quot;(empty)&quot; or &quot;(on which is a fish tank)&quot; to the names of containers and supporters. We can suppress or change the &quot;(empty)&quot; tag with the printing room description details of activity, as in</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing room description details: stop.</div>
</div><p>And we can suppress the &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(on which is&hellip;)&quot; sorts of tags with the &quot;omit the contents in listing&quot; phrase, as in</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;omit contents in listing.</div>
</div><p>Finally, the looking command lists visible non-scenery items that sit on scenery supporters, as in</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">On the table is a folded newspaper.</div>
</div><p>These paragraphs can be manipulated with the printing the locale description activity and the printing a locale paragraph about activity.</p>
<p>Another common thing we may want to do is change the description of a room depending on whether we&#39;ve been there before (as in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/slightly_wrong.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_slightly_wrong').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A room whose description changes slightly after our first visit there.">Slightly Wrong</a></span> ★★) or on how often we&#39;ve visited (as in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/infiltration.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_infiltration').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A room whose description changes depending on the number of times the player has visited.">Infiltration</a></span> ★). <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/night_sky.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_night_sky').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A room which changes its description depending on whether an object has been examined.">Night Sky</a></span> ★, meanwhile, changes the description of a room when we&#39;ve examined another object, so that the player&#39;s awareness of his environment is affected by other things the character knows.</p>

<p>A work of IF contains many spectacles and activities, and these must not all present themselves at once, or the player will be overwhelmed. One way to spread them out is in time, by having them available only as a plot develops, but another is to spread them out literally in space. The player has to walk between the Library and the Swimming Pool, and thus bookish and athletic tasks are not both presenting themselves at once. There have been valiant &quot;one-room&quot; IFs, and it forms a respectable sub-genre of the art, but most works of any size need a map.</p>
<p>Inform, following IF conventions, divides the world up into locations called &quot;rooms&quot;, connected together by so-called &quot;map connections&quot; along compass bearings. Thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Library is east of the Swimming Pool.</div>
</div><p>The example <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/port_royal.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_port_royal').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A partial implementation of Port Royal, Jamaica, set before the earthquake of 1692 demolished large portions of the city.">Port Royal</a></span> ★ develops a medium-sized map from such sentences. This develops in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/port_royal2.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_port_royal2').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Another part of Port Royal, with less typical map connections.">Port Royal 2</a></span> ★ to include connections which bend around, allowing the rooms not to lie on an imaginary square grid.</p>
<p>Because it is useful to group rooms together under names describing whole areas, Inform also allows rooms to be placed in &quot;regions&quot;. Thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Campus Area is a region. The Library and the Swimming Pool are in the Campus Area.</div>
</div><p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/port_royal3.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_port_royal3').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Division of Port Royal into regions.">Port Royal 3</a></span> ★ demonstrates this further. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/a&e.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_a&e').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Using regions to block access to an entire area when the player does not carry a pass, regardless of which entrance he uses.">A&amp;E</a></span> ★★ shows how regions can be used to write simple rules which regulate access to and from whole areas of the map.</p>
<p>Many old-school IF puzzles involve journeys through the map which are confused, randomised or otherwise frustrated: see <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/bee_chambers.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_bee_chambers').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A maze with directions between rooms randomized at the start of play.">Bee Chambers</a></span> ★ for a typical maze, <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/zork_ii.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_zork_ii').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A &quot;Carousel Room&quot;, as in Zork II, where moving in any direction from the room leads (at random) to one of the eight rooms nearby.">Zork II</a></span> ★ for a randomised connection, <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/prisoners_dilemma.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_prisoners_dilemma').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A button that causes a previously non-existent exit to come into being.">Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma</a></span> ★★ for a change in the map occurring during play. A completely random map takes us away from traditional IF and more towards a different sort of old-school game, the computerised role-playing game with its endless quests through dungeons with randomly generated treasures and monsters. This style of map &ndash; building itself one step at a time, as the player explores &ndash; can sometimes be useful to provide an illusion of infinite expanse: see <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/all_roads_lead_to_mars.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_all_roads_lead_to_mars').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Layout where the player is allowed to wander any direction he likes, and the map will arrange itself in order so that he finds the correct &quot;next&quot; location.">All Roads Lead To Mars</a></span> ★.</p>
<p>While the standard compass directions are conventional in IF, there are times when we may want to replace them without other forms of directional relationship. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/indirection.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_indirection').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Renaming the directions of the compass so that &quot;white&quot; corresponds to north, &quot;red&quot; to east, &quot;yellow&quot; to south, and &quot;black&quot; to west.">Indirection</a></span> ★ renames the compass directions to correspond to primary colors, as in Mayan thinking. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/world_of_charles_s_roberts.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_world_of_charles_s_roberts').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Replacing the ordinary compass bearings with a set of six directions to impose a hexagonal rather than square grid on the landscape.">The World of Charles S. Roberts</a></span> ★★ substitutes new ones, instead, introducing a hex-grid map in place of the usual one.</p>

<p>Inform&#39;s division of geography into &quot;rooms&quot; is a good compromise for most purposes. The rooms are cut off from each other by (imaginary or actual) walls, while all of the interior of a given room is regarded as the same place.</p>
<p>Suppose we want things to happen differently in different corners of the same room? Inform can already do this a little, in that the player can be inside an enterable container or on an enterable supporter. For instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of opening a door when the player is on the bed, say &quot;You can&#39;t reach the handle from the bed.&quot;</div>
</div><p>If we need to have divided-up areas of the floor itself, the standard approach is to define a small number of named positions. We then need to remember at which of these locations the player (or something else) currently stands.</p>
<p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/further_reasons_why_all_poets_are_liars.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_further_reasons_why_all_poets_are_liars').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="The young William Wordsworth, pushing a box about in his room, must struggle to achieve a Romantic point of view.">Further Reasons Why All Poets Are Liars</a></span> ★ allows the player to be in different parts of a room by standing on a box which can be in different places: thus only the box needs an internal position, not the player, simplifying matters neatly.</p>
<p>Another interesting case is when one room is entirely inside another (such as a hut in a field, or a booth in a large convention hall), so that the exterior of the room should be visible from another location. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/starry_void.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_starry_void').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Creating a booth that can be seen from the outside, opened and closed, and entered as a separate room.">Starry Void</a></span> ★★★ gives a simple demonstration of a magician&#39;s booth that can be examined from the outside, opened and closed, and entered to reach a new location.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?</p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/carnivale.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_carnivale').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An alternative to backdrops when we want something to be visible from a distance but only touchable from one room.">Carnivale</a></span> ★★ features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/eddystone.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_eddystone').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Creating new commands involving the standard compass directions.">Eddystone</a></span> ★★ an exceptionally bright one by night. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/waterworld.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_waterworld').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A backdrop which the player can examine, but cannot interact with in any other way.">Waterworld</a></span> ★ allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/view_of_green_hills.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_view_of_green_hills').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A LOOK [direction] command which allows the player to see descriptions of the nearby landscape.">View of Green Hills</a></span> ★★★ gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.</p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/tiny_garden.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_tiny_garden').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A lawn made up of several rooms, with part of the description written automatically.">Tiny Garden</a></span> ★★ gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/rock_garden.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_rock_garden').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A simple open landscape where the player can see between rooms and will automatically move to touch things in distant rooms.">Rock Garden</a></span> ★★ provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/stately_gardens.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_stately_gardens').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An open landscape where the player can see landmarks in nearby areas, with somewhat more complex room descriptions than the previous example, and in which we also account for size differences between things seen at a distance.">Stately Gardens</a></span> ★★★ provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.</p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/hotel_stechelberg.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_hotel_stechelberg').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Signposts such as those provided on hiking paths in the Swiss Alps, which show the correct direction and hiking time to all other locations.">Hotel Stechelberg</a></span> ★★ shows a signpost which treats these equally.</p>

<p>Inform&#39;s &quot;door&quot; kind provides for a tangible thing which comes between one room and another. A door can be open or closed, and openable or not: it can be locked or unlocked, and lockable or not. Here we create a conventional door, a natural gap in the rocks, and a (fixed in place) wooden ladder:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The fire door is an open door. The fire door is east of the Projection Booth and west of the Fire Escape.</div>
<div class="codeline">The narrow crevice is an open unopenable door. The crevice is east of the Col du Prafleuri and west of Rocky Knoll Above Arolla.</div>
<div class="codeline">The wooden ladder is an open unopenable door. The ladder is above the Stableyard and below the Hay Loft.</div>
</div><p>Most doors are visible from both sides: they are single objects but present in two rooms at once, which raises a number of complications. Inform normally uses the same description looking from each way, which is not very interesting: <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/when.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_when').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A door whose description says &quot;...leads east&quot; in one place and &quot;...leads west&quot; in the other.">When?</a></span> ★ and <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/whence.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_whence').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A kind of door that always automatically describes the direction it opens and what lies on the far side (if that other room has been visited).">Whence?</a></span> ★★★ demonstrate neat ways to describe the two sides differently, and <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/whither.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_whither').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A door whose description says where it leads; and which automatically understands references such as &quot;the west door&quot; and &quot;the east door&quot; depending on which direction it leads from the location.">Whither?</a></span> ★ adds the option for the player to refer to doors as &quot;the west door&quot; and &quot;the east door&quot; automatically.</p>
<p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/neighborhood_watch.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_neighborhood_watch').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A locked door that can be locked or unlocked without a key from one side, but not from the other.">Neighbourhood Watch</a></span> ★★ goes further by making a door behave differently on each side: from the &quot;outside&quot; you need a key, but &quot;inside&quot; it opens on a latch. Finally, <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/garibaldi.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_garibaldi').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Providing a security readout device by which the player can check on the status of all doors in the game.">Garibaldi</a></span> ★★★ shows how to access information about the two sides of a door.</p>
<p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/higher_calling.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_higher_calling').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="All doors in the game automatically attempt to open if the player approaches them when they are closed.">Higher Calling</a></span> ★ demonstrates doors which automatically open as needed: though using the Inform extension Locksmith by Emily Short is probably easier and better. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/elsie.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_elsie').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A door that closes automatically one turn after the player opens it.">Elsie</a></span> ★★, conversely, demonstrates a door that closes one turn after the player has opened it.</p>
<p>Certain complications apply when characters other than the player have to see and interact with doors that exist in other rooms. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/wainwright_acts.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_wainwright_acts').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A technical note about checking the location of door objects when characters other than the player are interacting with them.">Wainwright Acts</a></span> ★ demonstrates the syntax needed to handle this technically quirky situation.</p>

<p>Calvin Coolidge once described windows as &quot;rectangles of glass.&quot; For us, they have two purposes: first, they offer a view of landscape beyond. In the simplest case the view is of an area which will not be interacted with in play, and therefore does not need to adapt to whatever may have changed there:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The window is scenery in the Turret. &quot;Through the window you see miles and miles of unbroken forest, turning from green to flame in the hard early autumn.&quot;</div>
</div><p>More interesting is to adapt the view a little to provide a changing picture: a forest may not change much, but a street scene will. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/port_royal4.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_port_royal4').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A cell window through which the player can see people who were in Port Royal in the current year of game-time.">Port Royal 4</a></span> ★★ allows us to glimpse random passers-by.</p>
<p>The trickiest kind of window allows the player to see another room which can also be encountered in play, and to interact with what is there. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/dinner_is_served.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_dinner_is_served').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A window between two locations. When the window is open, the player can reach through into the other location; when it isn&#39;t, access is barred.">Dinner is Served</a></span> ★★ presents a shop window, allowing people to see inside from the street, and even to reach through.</p>
<p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/vitrine.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_vitrine').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An electrochromic window that becomes transparent or opaque depending on whether it is currently turned on.">Vitrine</a></span> ★ handles the complication of a window misting up to become opaque, and thus temporarily hiding its view.</p>
<p>Second, windows provide openings in walls and can act as conduits. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/escape.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_escape').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Window that can be climbed through or looked through.">Escape</a></span> ★★ shows how a &quot;door&quot; in the Inform sense can become a window. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/haughty_spirit.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_haughty_spirit').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Windows overlooking lower spaces which will prevent the player from climbing through if the lower space is too far below.">A Haughty Spirit</a></span> ★★★ provides a general kind of window for jumping down out of: ideal for escapers from Colditz-like castles.</p>

<div class="sect-navbar"><div class="sect-navbar-left"><a href="#section_6">3.6 Windows</a></div><div class="sect-navbar-center"><a href="#chapter_3">3. Place</a></div><div class="sect-navbar-right"><a href="#section_8">3.8 Sounds</a></div></div>
<p>At any place (room, or inside a container) light is either fully present or fully absent. Inform does not usually try to track intermediate states of lighting, but see <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/undertomb2.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_undertomb2').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Flickering lantern-light effects added to the Undertomb.">The Undertomb 2</a></span> ★★ for a single lantern with varying light levels and <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/zorn_of_zorna.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_zorn_of_zorna').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Light levels vary depending on the number of candles the player has lit, and this determines whether or not he is able to examine detailed objects successfully.">Zorn of Zorna</a></span> ★★★ for multiple candles that can be lit for cumulative changes to the light level.</p>
<p>Light can be added to, but not taken away: rooms and things can act as sources of light, by having the &quot;lighted&quot; and &quot;lit&quot; properties respectively, but they cannot be sinks which drain light away. The reason darkness is not a constant hazard in Inform-written games is that rooms always have the &quot;lighted&quot; property unless declared &quot;dark&quot;. (We assume daylight or some always-on electric lighting.) A &quot;dark&quot; room may well still be illuminated if a light source happens to be present:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Deep Crypt is a dark room. The candle lantern is a lit thing in the Deep Crypt.</div>
</div><p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/hymenaeus.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_hymenaeus').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Understanding &quot;flaming torch&quot; and &quot;extinguished torch&quot; to refer to torches when lit and unlit.">Hymenaeus</a></span> ★ allows us to explicitly refer to torches as &quot;lit&quot; or &quot;unlit&quot;, or (as synonyms) &quot;flaming&quot; or &quot;extinguished&quot;.</p>
<p>For light produced electrically we might want a wall switch, as in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/down_below.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_down_below').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A light switch which makes the room it is in dark or light.">Down Below</a></span> ★★, or a portable lamp, as in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/dark_ages_revisited.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_dark_ages_revisited').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An electric light kind of device which becomes lit when switched on and dark when switched off.">The Dark Ages Revisited</a></span> ★.</p>
<p>The fierce, locally confined light thrown out by a carried lamp has a quality quite unlike weak but ambient daylight, and <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/reflections.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_reflections').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Emphasizing the reflective quality of shiny objects whenever they are described in the presence of the torch.">Reflections</a></span> ★ exploits this to make a lantern feel more realistic.</p>
<p>When the player experiences darkness in a location, Inform is usually very guarded in what it reveals. (&quot;It is pitch dark, and you can&#39;t see a thing.&quot;) <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/hohmann_transfer.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_hohmann_transfer').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Changing the way dark rooms are described to avoid the standard Inform phrasing.">Hohmann Transfer</a></span> ★★ gives darkness a quite different look, and <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/four_stars.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_four_stars').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="An elaboration of the idea that when light is absent, the player should be given a description of what he can smell and hear, instead.">Four Stars</a></span> ★★★ heightens the other senses so that a player in darkness can still detect her surroundings. The first of the two examples in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/peeled.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_peeled').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Two different approaches to adjusting what the player can interact with, compared.">Peeled</a></span> ★ allows exploration of a dark place by touch.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to check whether a room that is not the current location happens to contain a light source or be naturally lighted. This poses a few challenges. <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/unblinking.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_unblinking').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Finding a best route through light-filled rooms only, leaving aside any that might be dark.">Unblinking</a></span> ★★★ demonstrates one way of doing this, so long as there are no backdrop light sources.</p>
<p><span class="example-name"><a href="examples/cloak_of_darkness.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_cloak_of_darkness').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Implementation of &quot;Cloak of Darkness&quot;, a simple example game that for years has been used to demonstrate the features of IF languages.">Cloak of Darkness</a></span> ★★★★ is a short and sweet game based on a light puzzle.</p>

<p>It is too easily assumed that room descriptions are what the player sees, but as <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/undertomb.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_undertomb').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="A small map of dead ends, in which the sound of an underground river has different strengths in different caves.">The Undertomb</a></span> ★ demonstrates, they might just as easily include ambient sounds.</p>
<p>So Inform&#39;s &quot;listening to&quot; action is the audio equivalent of &quot;examining&quot;, rather than &quot;looking&quot;. Despite this the player can type LISTEN, which Inform understands as listening to the everything in the location at once. A simple but effective way to handle this is shown in <span class="example-name"><a href="examples/art_of_noise.html" onClick="(function() { document.getElementById('example_art_of_noise').setAttribute('open','open'); return true; })();" title="Things are all assigned their own noise (or silence).
