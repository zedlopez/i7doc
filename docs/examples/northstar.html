<p>Most of the time, Inform understands commands to other characters when they take the form &quot;JOSH, TAKE INVENTORY&quot; or &quot;JOAN, WEAR THE ARMOR&quot;. But novice players might also try commands of the form ASK JOSH TO TAKE INVENTORY or ORDER JOAN TO WEAR THE ARMOR.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make Inform understand such commands is to meddle directly with the player&#39;s command, changing it into the format that the game will understand, as here:</p>
