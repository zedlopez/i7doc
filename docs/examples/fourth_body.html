<p>Some mystery games supply the player with an in-game system for taking notes, in case he doesn&#39;t want to rely on scraps of paper next to the computer. One way of doing this is to write out all the player&#39;s notes and observations into a notebook file, whose contents can be retrieved during play (or, indeed, after it).</p>
<p>We&#39;ll first invent a general system for writing text into notebooks, by creating a new kind called jotter. Each individual jotter will have its own disc file, and there will be basically three things which can be done with jotters: erasing, reading and writing.</p>

<div class="codeline">A jotter is a kind of thing. A jotter has an external file called the text file. A jotter can be fresh or used. A jotter is usually fresh. A jotter has a text called the heading.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The currently erased jotter is an object that varies.</div>
<div class="codeline">To erase (pad - a jotter):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the currently erased jotter is the pad;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;write &quot;[heading of the currently erased jotter][paragraph break]&quot; to the text file of the pad;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the pad is fresh.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To write in (pad - a jotter):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;append &quot;[the time of day]: [topic understood][line break]&quot; to the text file of the pad;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the pad is used.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To read (pad - a jotter):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You read: [paragraph break][text of the text file of the pad]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>This is all as might be expected, except perhaps for the business of the &quot;currently erased jotter&quot;. Why copy &quot;pad&quot; into this &ndash; why not simply write &quot;[heading of the pad]&quot;? The answer is that &quot;pad&quot; is a temporary &quot;let&quot; value, and cannot be used inside other phrases, such as the &quot;write &hellip; to &hellip;&quot; phrase.</p>
<p>We want to erase any jotters when play begins, as otherwise text left over from any previous games will still be visible:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with pad running through jotters:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;erase the pad.</div>
</div><p>Now we need to create rules to allow the player to control reading, writing and erasing. Reading we will handle with the ordinary examining action, but we create new actions for writing and erasing. A nice little trick allows WRITE WHATEVER to default to writing WHATEVER in a notebook being carried.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of examining a used jotter (called the pad):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;read the pad.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining a fresh jotter (called the pad):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;There is nothing of note in [the pad].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;write [text] in [something preferably held]&quot; as writing it in. Understand &quot;write [text]&quot; as writing it in.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check writing it in:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is not a jotter, say &quot;It would be better to write in a notebook.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out writing it in:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;write in the second noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report writing it in:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Under the current time, you write &#39;[the topic understood]&#39; into [the second noun].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;erase [something preferably held]&quot; as erasing. Erasing is an action applying to one carried thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
