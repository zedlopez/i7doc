<p>We have two things to keep track of with our layering clothing: what currently is covering something else; and what <em>can</em> cover something else. This implementation goes for a fairly simple treatment, assuming that each item of clothing will completely conceal those beneath it, and that we are not implementing entire sets of shirts, jackets, etc. But it will do for a demonstration.</p>

<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Underlying relates one thing to various things. The verb to underlie means the underlying relation. The verb to be under implies the underlying relation.</div>
</div><p>And now we prevent taking a lower layer off before the thing that is worn over it:</p>

<div class="codeline">say &quot;(first removing [the impediment])[command clarification break]&quot;;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is uppermost if it is not under something.</div>
</div><p>That covers order of clothing removal, but we also want to restrict what can be worn on top of what else. This time we need Inform to have some idea of what customarily can be layered on top of what other clothing:</p>

<div class="codeline">Covering relates a thing (called A) to a thing (called B) when the number of steps via the overlying relation from A to B is greater than 0. The verb to cover means the covering relation.</div>
</div><p>With these definitions, we can say that a jacket should go over a shirt and a shirt over an undershirt (say), and then Inform will know that a jacket will cover both shirt and undershirt.</p>
