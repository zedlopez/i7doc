<div class="example-body"><p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Procedure</div></div><p>We start by creating the idea that everything in the game has a monetary value:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A price is a kind of value. $10 specifies a price. A thing has a price.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;give [things preferably held] to [someone]&quot; as multiply-giving it to. Understand &quot;give [things] to [someone]&quot; as multiply-giving it to.  Multiply-giving it to is an action applying to two things.</div>
</div><p>A subtlety here: we say &quot;things preferably held&quot; to prefer items that the player is holding (so if the player has two dollars in hand and a third lies on the ground, he will use just the two he has).</p>
<p>The second grammar line allows Inform to match things that aren&#39;t held if it can&#39;t make up the list from things that are. If all three dollars are on the ground, the player can pick them up before spending them.</p>
<p>We do not, however, make multiply-giving apply to a &quot;carried&quot; item, because that will generate implicit takes of those items in a way that will mess up our action reporting. Instead, we&#39;re going to build the implicit takes into the system in a different way, one that permits us to collate the reports more attractively and print a short, one-sentence list of anything that the player had to pick up.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A thing can be given or ungiven. A thing is usually ungiven.</div>
</div><p>This is for record-keeping purposes so that we can print an attractive list of what was given at the end of the turn.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">First check multiply-giving it to:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if already gave at the office is true:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stop the action.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Already gave at the office is a truth state that varies.</div>
</div><p>&quot;Already gave at the office&quot; is the perhaps-excessively-named flag that keeps track of whether we&#39;ve already done this action once.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Check multiply-giving something to the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now already gave at the office is true;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can hardly bribe yourself.[paragraph break]&quot; instead;</div>
</div><p>The following rule is longish because it processes the entire list at once, generating implicit takes if necessary (but processing those implicit takes silently according to its own special rule, so that the output can be managed attractively). We are also, at the same time, calculating the total value of the player&#39;s offer.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Check multiply-giving it to:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be the multiple object list;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let bribe-price be $0;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through L:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the item:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;abide by the ungivability rules for the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;carry out the implicitly taking activity with the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player does not carry the item:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now already gave at the office is true;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can&#39;t include [the item] in your bribe, since you&#39;re not holding [them]![paragraph break]&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase bribe-price by the price of item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of entries in the recently-collected list is greater than 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through the recently-collected list:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now item is marked for listing;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You pick up [the list of marked for listing things] and make your offer. [run paragraph on]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now everything is unmarked for listing;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the bribe-price is less than the price of the second noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now already gave at the office is true;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The second noun] angrily rejects your piffling bribe.[paragraph break]&quot; instead.</div>
</div><p>The bit about making some items &quot;marked for listing&quot;, above, rather than printing the list directly, is that using the &quot;[the list of&hellip;.]&quot; syntax guarantees that Inform will respect grouping rules in writing its description. For instance, if the player has automatically taken all three dollars, the output will say &quot;the three dollars&quot; instead of &quot;the dollar, the dollar, and the dollar.&quot;</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out multiply-giving it to:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let L be the multiple object list;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through L:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the second noun carries the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the item is given;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now already gave at the office is true;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report multiply-giving it to:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The second noun] rather shamefacedly tucks [the list of given things] away into a pocket.[paragraph break]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>Now we create our own variation of implicitly taking in order to customize the output for the multiply-giving action. The &quot;ungivability rules&quot; should disallow any object that the player absolutely cannot take, because we want &quot;carry out the implicitly taking activity&quot; to succeed every time -- and therefore not print out any less-attractive results from implicit takes that don&#39;t succeed. Otherwise, the player&#39;s GIVE TREE AND DOG TO ATTENDANT might produce the reply &quot;That&#39;s fixed in place&quot; -- without specifying which object is fixed in place.</p>
<p>Because of the way this works, we will want to be careful: if we have any &quot;instead of taking&hellip;&quot; rules for special objects in the game, we should be sure to mirror those with an ungivability rule to print something more suitable in the case that the player tries taking that object as part of the multiple giving action.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The ungivability rules are an object-based rulebook.</div>
