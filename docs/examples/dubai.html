<div class="example-body"><p>The problem of implementing an elevator that opens onto a large number of floors often challenges novice interactive fiction authors. It also raises a fundamental design problem &ndash; how to implement a large building in an interesting way. It is tempting to write a hotel with an elevator and innumerable tedious and identical floors just for the sake of realism; in many cases it is a better idea simply to omit any locations that contribute nothing to the story or the play of the game.</p>
<p>In charity, though, let us assume that the author has a legitimate reason for wanting to implement an elevator that opens onto some generic floors. We will go whole-hog, and set this in the world&#39;s tallest hotel: Burj al-Arab, Dubai.</p>

</div></details><p>This will all work very well, unless the player has portable objects; in that case, anything he drops on the Generic Floor will be there every time he goes back &ndash; whether it&#39;s masquerading as Floor 6 or Floor 23. There are there are two ways round this &ndash; (i) the cheeky way. When we drop something, the unobtrusive yet ever-vigilant maids pick it up and take it down to the Foyer&#39;s lost property office; and (ii) the super-duper way, in which things are moved out of play but with their floor numbers remembered, so that the scenario can be reconstructed each time. (i) is probably in fact the more true-to-life, considering the hotel&#39;s boasts about its service, but we will demonstrate both methods.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this example was almost set in an entirely different location: the largest hotel in the world may some day be the Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang, North Korea, with its 105 floors &ndash; but for some years construction halted at the creation of the building&#39;s huge concrete shell.</p>
