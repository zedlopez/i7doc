<p>In our previous implementations of playing cards, we&#39;ve gotten as far as creating decks of individual cards that the player can draw and discard. But in a poker game, one doesn&#39;t just have a collection of cards: one has a hand of a specific kind.</p>
<p>Here we take on the job of writing an inventory listing for a poker hand that will reflect the real value of what the player has drawn. To do this, we create a rulebook to sort and assess the cards in the player&#39;s hand; its possible return values are limited to the kinds of poker hands that exist, from &quot;high card&quot; to &quot;royal flush&quot;.</p>
<p>The first three sections, creating the deck of cards and the means to parse their names, are identical to those we&#39;ve already seen in Tilt 1; new material begins at section 4.</p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we&#39;re simulating something akin to five-card draw without wilds; stud or hold-em variations would add some other complexities.</p>

<div class="codeline">Before grouping together cards:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for grouping together cards:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[list hand]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say list hand:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let chosen card be the first thing held by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;while chosen card is a card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[chosen card]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now chosen card is the next thing held after chosen card;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if chosen card is a card, say &quot;, &quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After grouping together cards:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;)&quot;.</div>
</div><p>The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rules is a rulebook. The hand-ranking rules have outcomes royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, high card.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the flushness.</div>
<div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the straightness.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the pair count.</div>
<div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the triple count.</div>
<div class="codeline">The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the quadruple count.</div>
</div><p>For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player&#39;s hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on &quot;Looking at containment by hand&quot; in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player&#39;s hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player&#39;s hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A card can be sorted or unsorted. A card is usually unsorted.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a card is high if its rank is 11 or more.</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a card is low if its rank is 4 or less.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the initial sort rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now every card is unsorted;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;while the player carries an unsorted card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let item be the lowest unsorted card held by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move item to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the item is sorted;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after initial sort: [list hand]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we&#39;ll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it&#39;s on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.</p>
<p>Next up, a check to see whether the player has a flush:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the finding flushness rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let called suit be the suit of a random card carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if every card carried by the player is called suit, now flushness is true.</div>
</div><p>Now we check for straights; this is slightly complicated by the fact that an ace can be either the bottom of a low straight (lower than 2) or the top of a high straight (higher than king), so we explicitly check both possibilities.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the finding straightness rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now straightness is true;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let N be the rank of the highest card which is carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;repeat with current rank running from N - 4 to N:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the test rank is the current rank;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;unless the player carries a matching card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the current rank is N - 4 and the current rank is 9 and the player carries an ace card, do nothing; [this covers the case where an ace could be the top card of the sequence]</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise now straightness is false.</div>
</div><p>And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player&#39;s hand when we take inventory.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A card can be quadrupled, tripled, paired or uncombined.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test rank is a number that varies. Definition: a card is matching if its rank is the test rank.</div>
</div><p>This definition is a convenience so that we don&#39;t have to write so many explicit loops in the following rule:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the counting multiples rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now every card is uncombined;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;repeat with current rank running from 1 to 13:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now test rank is current rank;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be the number of matching cards held by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if N is 4:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the quadruple count;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every matching card held by the player is quadrupled;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if N is 3:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the triple count;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every matching card held by the player is tripled;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if N is 2:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the pair count;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every matching card held by the player is paired.</div>
</div><p>Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:</p>
<p>1) we want to list aces as high unless they are serving as the bottom of a low straight, in which case they should appear last;</p>
<p>2) we want combinations to appear at the front of the list, sorted from highest value to lowest value: larger combinations first, then smaller combinations, and combinations of equal size sorted by rank.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the move aces up unless there&#39;s a low straight rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;unless the straightness is true and the lowest card carried by the player is an ace card and the rank of the highest card carried by the player is 5,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every ace card which is carried by the player is carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after ace movement rule: [list hand]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the move pairs forward rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;while the player carries a paired card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let selection be the lowest paired card which is carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the selection to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the selection is uncombined;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after pairs movement: [list hand]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the raise ace pairs rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player carries exactly two ace cards:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through ace cards which are carried by the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move item to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after paired-ace movement: [list hand]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the move multiples forward rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;while the player carries a tripled card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let selection be the lowest tripled card which is carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the selection to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the selection is uncombined;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;while the player carries a quadrupled card:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let selection be the lowest quadrupled card which is carried by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the selection to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the selection is uncombined;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after multiples movement rule: [list hand]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a card is ace if its rank is 1.</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a card is king if its rank is 13.</div>
</div><p>Now, having determined the salient qualities of our hand, we run through rules in order from the highest kind of poker combination to the lowest. Because of the order of the source, Inform will choose whichever combination applies first.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the royal-flush rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if flushness is true and straightness is true and the highest card carried by the player is king and the lowest card carried by the player is ace, royal flush.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the straight-flushes rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if flushness is true and straightness is true, straight flush.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the four-of-a-kind rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the quadruple count is 1, four of a kind.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the full-house rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the pair count is 1 and the triple count is 1, full house.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the flushes rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if flushness is true, flush.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the straights rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if straightness is true, straight.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the three-of-a-kind rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if triple count is 1, three of a kind.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the two-pair rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the pair count is 2, two pairs.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the pair rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the pair count is 1, pair.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A hand-ranking rule (this is the default rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;high card.</div>
</div><p>And finally, we need to define our debugging variable here, even though we won&#39;t give the player the ability to turn it on and off except in the special testing section.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Sort-debugging is a truth state that varies.</div>
</div><p>For many examples, a test-me script is enough to prove that the example does what it ought. This example, though, is a bit more complicated, and hard to test randomly. The remainder of the source here shows how we might write a test to verify the desired behavior of our rulebook. Those who are only interested in the rulebook itself can stop reading at this point.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 5 - Testing hand identification - Not for release</div></div><p>For the sake of testing our rules, we provide an apparatus that will load the player&#39;s hand up with sample hands of each kind, then show the result to make sure that the hand is being correctly identified.</p>

</div><p>The somewhat rough-and-ready principle of this table is that we will overwrite the cards in the player&#39;s hand by resetting their ranks and suits; every five rows of the table represent a new poker hand for the game to attempt to sort and identify. These include one example of each of the major kinds of poker hand, plus a couple of variations involving aces which test the special sorting rules.</p>
