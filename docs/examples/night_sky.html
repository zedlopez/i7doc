<p>Sometimes a nice effect is to change the way things are described depending on the information the player has gained in the course of play. We could for instance write this:</p>

</div></details><p>The reason is that our Instead rule has pre-empted normal listening, so Inform considers that we have never successfully heard the message. The moral here is that &quot;if we have&hellip;&quot; is useful for tracking events that otherwise proceeded completely normally (picking up ordinary objects, examining things); if we have used instead to make some change, we will have to use a different approach to record that the event did occur as scheduled.</p>
