<div class="example-body"><p>As we have seen, there are a number of different ways of controlling conversation in interactive fiction, and the best choice of way will depend quite a lot on what kind of work we&#39;re writing.</p>
<p>One common model is to replace Inform&#39;s default ASK and TELL commands with a TALK TO command. This gives the player less control than he would otherwise have: instead of asking a character about any topic under the sun, he&#39;s restricted to seeing (or not seeing) a single sequence of text that the author has written in advance. On the other hand, such a system is harder for the player to break (since he can never ask about a topic that the author hasn&#39;t implemented), and easier for the author to tie into plot developments. If we give TALK TO different output at each scene, we get conversation that is always tied to the current state of the plot.</p>
<p>This is a design approach that works best in a game with a large number of short, focused scenes. For other kinds of conversation system design, compare the other examples listed in the Recipe Book.</p>

Episode begins when Parodos ends.\n\nWhen Episode begins:\n\tmove Heracles to the theater;\n\tsay &quot;The chorus falls silent, which is the cue: Heracles bursts out of the scene building.&quot;\n\nHeracles is a man. The description is &quot;Hard to mistake in his lion skin and boots, and carrying a formidable club.&quot; Heracles wears a lion skin and boots. He carries a formidable club. Heracles can be placid or annoyed. Heracles is placid. Heracles can be satisfied, intrigued, or unsatisfied.

The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.&quot;\n&quot;Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread.&quot;\n&quot;The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year&apos;s Lenaia winner, &apos;The Bees&apos;. With a jolt, you realize that you&apos;ve missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you.&quot;\n&quot;Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron.&quot;\n&quot;The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row.&quot;\n&quot;Inspired by Euripides[&apos;] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don&apos;t speak at last, the play will come to a halt.&quot;\n&quot;Silence descends.&quot;\n\nRule for writing a paragraph about Heracles during Episode:\n\tsay &quot;[Heracles] stands at the center of the orchestra, with members of [the chorus] ranged on either side.

<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 2 - Parodos</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Parodos is a scene. Parodos begins when Prologue ends.</div>

<div class="codeline">When Parodos begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the chorus to the theater.</div>

</div><p>This last rule is a refinement borrowing from the <a href="WI_18.html">Activities chapter</a>, which gives characters different appearances in room descriptions depending on when we happen to look; because of the action of the play, we want to show the chorus and audience doing different things during different scenes.</p>

</div><p>And now a scene in which the player can talk several times to a character (Heracles) but has no useful dialogue with the chorus, the audience, or himself.
