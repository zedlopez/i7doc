<p>Scenes can have properties -- a fact that is very useful when it comes to writing a series of scenes that all need to act alike in some respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a plot that features a number of scripted scenes, where we need the player to stand still and wait while the events of the scene play out. One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let&#39;s call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>

</div><p>And now let&#39;s set up our restricted scene. In it, a clown is going to turn up wherever the player is (it doesn&#39;t matter where on the map he&#39;s gotten to at this point) and do a performance; the player will not be able to leave the area until the performance completes. We&#39;ll start with the setting:</p>
