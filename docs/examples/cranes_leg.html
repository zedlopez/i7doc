<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">When you see a long object, you don&#39;t have to think that it is too long if being long is the property given by the nature. It is proved by the fact that a duckling, having short legs, will cry if you try to draw them out by force, and that a crane, having long legs, will protest you with tears if you try to cut them with a knife. -- Zhuangzi</div>
</div><p>Suppose we have an extremely detailed world model in which every object is characterized by many features -- in this example, material and height, though one could add more. Suppose further that we would like to generate descriptions of these things automatically for the most part, drawing the player&#39;s attention only to those aspects of the object that are particularly interesting.</p>

<div class="codeline">Material is a kind of value. The materials are wood, glass, stone, cloth, paper, clay, and metal. A thing has a material.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A height is a kind of value. 3 feet 11 inches specifies a height. A thing has a height. Definition: a thing is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 inches or more. Definition: a thing is short if its height is 2 feet 0 inches or less.</div>
</div><p>So far, we have generally dealt with cases where the property of a thing can be a number (such as 3), a value (such as brightness), or a unit (like height, here). It is also possible for a thing to have a property which names another thing, as in &quot;The mother of the baby trout is the large trout&quot; -- where &quot;mother&quot; is a property, and its value, in the case of the baby trout, is large trout. We would define such a property with a line such as &quot;A fish has a thing called the mother.&quot;</p>
<p>In practice, though, this is a bit confusing as syntax; moreover, Inform has a much more powerful construct for talking about the ways in which one object relates to another object. A full discussion of this will have to wait for the chapter on Relations. For now, it is enough to say that we can do this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Imitation relates various things to one thing (called the ideal). The verb to imitate means the imitation relation.</div>
</div><p>This will allow us to declare that some objects imitate other objects, like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is always enterable. A chair is usually wood. The height of a chair is usually 4 feet 0 inches. The ordinary chair is a chair. Every chair imitates the ordinary chair.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A table is a kind of supporter. A table is usually wood. The height of a table is usually 3 feet 8 inches. The ordinary table is a table. Every table imitates the ordinary table.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A rock is a kind of thing. A rock is usually stone. The ordinary rock is a rock. Every rock imitates the ordinary rock. The height of a rock is usually 0 feet 3 inches.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A jug is a kind of container. A jug is usually clay. The ordinary jug is a jug. Every jug imitates the ordinary jug. The height of a jug is usually 0 feet 8 inches.</div>
</div><p>Now each of these types has one ideal representative which has the fundamental attributes of its kind: the ordinary chair is the most chairlike chair imaginable, the ordinary table is the epitome of tableness, and so on. We are also allowed to refer to &quot;the ideal of the chair&quot;, thanks to the way we defined imitation. (Again, the relations chapter offers a much more detailed explanation of how relations may be defined.)</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The description of a thing is usually &quot;[comparison with ideal][run paragraph on]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say comparison with ideal:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let the sample be the ideal of the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the sample is not a thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Perfectly conforming to your expectations of its type.&quot;;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the material of the noun is not the material of the sample:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is shorter than the sample, say &quot;Unusually short at [height of the noun], and made of [material of the noun].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise say &quot;Unusually tall at [height of the noun], and made of [material of the noun].&quot;;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;In every respect [a sample].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Pleasure Garden is a room. &quot;At the riverbank, a pleasing garden, having many curving paths and one straight.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The low table is a table in the Pleasure Garden. The height of the low table is 2 feet 3 inches. On the low table is a metal rock called a gold nugget.</div>

</div></details><p>So far the effect is not very deep, but we could take the auto-description a great deal further: providing a larger and more interesting set of variations; or writing a complicated set of rules such that the player only notices height variations when carrying a ruler; or switching between several player-characters, each of whom notices a different subset of characteristics. But these refinements would require more input from later chapters.</p>
