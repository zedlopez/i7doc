<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose we have an item that produces an interesting result the first time the player lifts it -- a rock with dangerous ants revealed underneath. The effect of the surprise is a little weakened, though, if the player sees that response as the result of a TAKE ALL, when it might be printed like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&gt;[3] get all</div>
<div class="codeline">tent peg: Taken.</div>
<div class="codeline">water flask: Taken.</div>
<div class="codeline">trading permit: Taken.</div>
<div class="codeline">innocent-looking rock: You reach for the rock and turn it over to reveal a thriving colony of flesh-eating ants. Needless to say, you drop the rock and jump back with a decidedly effeminate scream. They can probably hear you all the way back in the base camp.</div>
<div class="codeline">rusty nail: Taken.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">[Your score has just gone down by two points.]</div>
</div><p>The calm response to &quot;rusty nail&quot; looks odd now, and the score change is disconnected from the event that caused it.</p>
<p>To manage this, we might institute a system so that interesting objects are handled last in their list, like so:</p>
