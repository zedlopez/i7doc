<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose we want a bookshelf with a very large number of books on it. They aren&#39;t to be taken or carried around in the game, but they should be mentioned, and the player should be allowed to look them up by name. Furthermore, the player&#39;s attempts to examine something unrecognized should be understood as an attempt to look up a title -- but only when the player is in the presence of the books. The rest of the time such requests should be rejected in the usual way.</p>
