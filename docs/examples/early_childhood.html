</div></details><p>But a kind cannot change during play, so this will not do. Instead, the colour will have to be a property of the block. So we might first try this:</p>

</div></details><p>Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees &quot;eleven blocks&quot;. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an activity called &quot;printing the name of&quot;:</p>

</div></details><p>This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type &quot;take a green block&quot;, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as &quot;eleven blocks&quot; in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:</p>
<div class="play-example borogove"><a class="raw" href="https://snippets.borogove.app/inform7/v10ex55d">Play/modify in Borogove</a></div>

</div><p>And now everything works nicely: the blocks are grouped by colour, and can be referred to by colour, and we can even change the colour of an individual block during play, using a bit of extra trickery from later:</p>
