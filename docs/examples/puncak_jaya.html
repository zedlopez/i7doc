<div class="example-body"><p>By default, when something is not present, Inform does not allow a player to refer to it. But there are times when we might like to acknowledge that the thing mentioned in a command does exist somewhere in the game; it just happens not to be on hand right now.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to make an object that appears everywhere and responds to the name of its owner only when the owner itself is not in view.</p>

</div><p>We make the ghost a person rather than some other kind of thing so that it will be able to respond to commands such as KISS BOB or (even trickier) BOB, JUMP: if Inform did not recognize the ghost as an animate creature, it would not accept such input.</p>

</div><p>This is, technically, an assembly -- except instead of saying that every device has a button part, or that there are three daffodils in every garden room, the assembly is based on a non-physical relation that we just designed.</p>
<p>Based on the &quot;representation&quot; relation, we now devise a conditional relation that applies only when the represented thing is not itself in view:</p>
