<div class="codeline">The block giving rule is not listed in the check giving it to rules.</div>
</div><p>As it happens, correct behavior is built into the GIVE command once &quot;block giving&quot; is turned off, so we do not have to write a replacement report or carry-out rule; the object will be transferred to the possession of the caterpillar. But we do want to adjust the action just a little so that our gift cheers up the recipient:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out giving (this is the gratitude for gifts rule): improve the mood of the second noun.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Mood is a kind of value. The moods are hostile, suspicious, indifferent, friendly, and adoring. An animal has a mood. An animal is usually indifferent.</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the mood of character is less than friendly, now the mood of the character is the mood after the mood of the character.</div>
</div><p>Now whenever we give something to an animal, the animal will be pleased about the present. Of course, we might also want to add a check rule to giving, to see whether the offering is something the recipient really wants:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Check giving (this is the polite refusal of unwanted objects rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;unless the noun interests the second noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The second noun] disdainfully refuses [the noun].&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To decide whether (item - a thing) interests (character - a person):</div>

<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of showing something to someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">try giving the noun to the second noun.</div>
</div><p>There is already a perfectly workable report rule that will describe what happens when we give something to someone, but let&#39;s say we want to report on the recipient&#39;s changed mood, too:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After giving something to someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You give [the noun] to [the second noun], who appears mollified and is now merely [mood of the second noun].&quot;</div>
