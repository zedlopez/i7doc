<div class="example-body"><p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.</p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing &ndash; we will see in the <a href="WI_19.html">chapter on Rulebooks</a> that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.</p>
