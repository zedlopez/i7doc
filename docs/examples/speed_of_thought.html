<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose that we have a number of objects in the game that are sized in some conventional unit (such as meters), but which we would like to describe in slightly less formal terms. To do this, we will start with measurements as defined in the built-in extension Metric Units, so we don&#39;t have to recreate all these.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll add our own set of &quot;conceptual units&quot; &ndash; things we&#39;re familiar with in real life. As we&#39;ll see below, Inform will automatically choose a unit of the right order to express a given distance if we tell it to print a length &quot;in conceptual units&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: the following will compile only if you have settings set for Glulx. (To change this, go to the Settings panel and click on the Glulx option.) The Glulx virtual machine is capable of handling larger numbers than the Z-machine.</p>
