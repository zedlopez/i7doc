<p class="example-desc">A number of sleuths (the player among them) find themselves aboard the Orient Express, where a murder has taken place, and one of them is apparently the culprit. Naturally they do not agree on whom, but there is physical evidence which may change their minds&hellip;</p>

<p>The following example creates two new relations, and two new verbs, in order to set up a tangled web of intrigue.</p>

<div class="codeline">The Dining Car is a room. Lord Peter is a man in the Dining Car. Sherlock Holmes is a man in the Dining Car. Miss Marple is a woman in the Dining Car. Adam Dalgliesh is a man in the Dining Car.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Suspecting relates various people to one person.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>

<div class="codeline">Exculpating relates one thing to various people.</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The pipe ash, the letter and the silver bullet are carried.</div>
</div><p>Given this, we can then set up elaborate rules:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of showing something to a person who suspects the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;&#39;You would say that,&#39; remarks [the second noun] darkly.&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of showing something which exculpates the player to someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;&#39;How striking!&#39; says [the second noun]. &#39;Almost I begin to distrust myself.&#39;&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;show the letter to miss marple / show the silver bullet to holmes&quot;.</div>
</div><details class="testme-output"><summary>Test me with "show the letter to miss marple / show the silver bullet to holmes".</summary><div class="testme-output">Dining Car<br>You can see Lord Peter, Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple and Adam Dalgliesh here.<br><br>&gt;(Testing.)<br><br>&gt;[1] show the letter to miss marple<br>&quot;You would say that,&quot; remarks Miss Marple darkly.<br><br>&gt;[2] show the silver bullet to holmes<br>&quot;How striking!&quot; says Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Almost I begin to distrust myself.&quot;
</div></details><p>And so on: &quot;if Dalgliesh suspects someone who is exculpated by something carried by the player&hellip;&quot;, for instance, makes a fitting final example for this chapter. The description</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">someone who is exculpated by something carried by the player</div>
</div><p>expresses a complicated idea in very few words, and in such a way that a passer-by looking at the source text would immediately see what was meant.</p>
<p>The moral is that relations allow sophisticated patterns of behaviour to be created in a way that reads back naturally as English.</p>
