<div class="codeline">The window throws on the floor a bright square of malevolent sunlight[otherwise]The stalls for horses run down one side of the room, but the house has long stood empty. A square window without shutters looks out over the ranch, away toward the Sierras[end if].&quot;</div>

<div class="codeline">Teresa is a woman in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Teresa stands opposite you[if Teresa carries something], her fingers wrapped tightly around [a list of things carried by Teresa][end if].&quot; Teresa carries a bulb of garlic and a cross.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Maleska is a man in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Maleska watches you from eyes entirely black.&quot; Maleska carries a skull.</div>
</div><p>If we tried the text above in Inform, we would find ourselves in the Hay-Strewn Corridor and confronted by both Teresa and Maleska. If &quot;player&quot; is not set to any named person, Inform creates a bland person called &quot;yourself&quot; to represent the player. To avoid this, we set &quot;player&quot; to the person we want to begin as. The player character is normally privately-named, so we&#39;ll need to make sure &quot;Maleska&quot; still means what it should.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The player is Maleska. Understand &quot;Maleska&quot; as Maleska.</div>
</div><p>Now the Corridor contains just two people, and we arrive on the scene as Maleska, with only Teresa facing us.</p>
<p>At the end of every turn we will use the &#39;now the player is&hellip;&#39; phrase. (This looks as if it simply changes the value of &quot;player&quot;: which it does, but it also carries out a complicated operation behind the scenes to effect the switch.)</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every turn:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is Maleska, now the player is Teresa;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise now the player is Maleska.</div>
</div><p>Our two characters already see the Corridor differently, but let&#39;s differentiate them further:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every person has a number called strength. The strength of Teresa is 3. The strength of Maleska is 5.</div>
</div><p>In this small example, strength is not used for anything, except that we will display it on the status line:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the command prompt is &quot;[bold type][player][roman type] &gt; &quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the left hand status line is &quot;[player]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the right hand status line is &quot;STR: [strength of the player]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>That last rule doesn&#39;t quite do what we might have expected. When we print &quot;[player]&quot;, we find that Inform usually prints &quot;yourself&quot;. This is because Inform says &quot;you&quot; to mean Teresa when talking to the player-being-Teresa, and likewise for Maleska. We want to override that in this particular story, because the rapid switches of personality are otherwise hard to follow. So:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of Teresa: say &quot;Teresa&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for printing the name of Maleska: say &quot;Maleska&quot;.</div>
