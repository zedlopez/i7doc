<div class="codeline">A jacket is a kind of thing. A jacket is always wearable.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A pocket is a kind of container. A pocket is part of every jacket. The carrying capacity of a pocket is always 2.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After examining a jacket:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let target be a random pocket which is part of the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The target] contains [a list of things in the target].&quot;</div>
</div><p>Now we&#39;ve created the rules that will govern any specific jackets we might happen to put in our game: each one will always have one pocket, which will be able to contain no more than two things. The description of &quot;a list of things&quot; is text with a list, which we will learn about further in a few sections.</p>
<p>Next we might want to create the environment and an actual example of the jacket kind:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Tent is a room. &quot;A dome made of two flexible rods and a lot of bright green ripstop nylon. It bills itself as a one-man tent, but you&#39;d call it a two-dwarf tent: there is no way to arrange yourself on its square floor so that you can stretch out completely.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hoodie is a jacket. &quot;Your hoodie is balled up in the corner.&quot; The description of the hoodie is &quot;Both elbows are stained from yesterday&#39;s entrenching project.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The hoodie&#39;s pocket contains a Swiss army knife and a folded map. The hoodie is in the Tent.</div>
</div><p>Notice that, since Inform has created a pocket for the hoodie, we can now refer to it by name in our source, giving it any additional properties we need to define. Here we simply put a few items into it.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The player wears a whistle. The description of the whistle is &quot;To frighten bears.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
