</div><p>And then we define the scene so that it ends when the table runs out.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Lecture ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Lecture Events is 0.</div>
</div><p>One advantage of this is that we can then edit the events in the scene by changing just the table; the scene will always run the right length and end on the turn when the last event occurs.</p>
<p>And to add a few additional details:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of doing something other than waiting, looking, listening or examining during Lecture:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Dr Freitag glares at you so fiercely that you are frozen into inaction.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Notice the careful phrasing of &quot;doing something other than&hellip;&quot; so that we do not mention the objects; if we had written &quot;something other than listening to something&hellip;&quot;, the instead rule would match only action patterns which involved a noun. We state the rule more generally so that it will also match nounless commands such as JUMP and SING, since Freitag will probably take a dim view of those as well.</p>
