<div class="codeline">Corinth is a room. Athens is east of Corinth. Epidaurus is southeast of Corinth and east of Mycenae. Mycenae is south of Corinth. Olympia is west of Mycenae. Argos is south of Mycenae. Thebes is northwest of Athens. Pylos is south of Olympia. Sparta is east of Pylos and south of Argos. Delphi is northwest of Thebes.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;look [direction]&quot; as facing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Facing is an action applying to one visible thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out facing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the viewed item be the room noun from the location;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the viewed item is not a room, say &quot;You can&#39;t see anything promising that way.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try looking toward the viewed item.</div>
</div><p>In rules about action handling, &quot;noun&quot; refers to the first object that the player has mentioned in his command, so if the player typed &gt;LOOK WEST, &quot;let the viewed item be the room noun from the location&quot; would be processed as &quot;let the viewed item be the room west from the location&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>We can at need override the default behavior, if it is not going to be appropriate for the player to see the next room over. There is only sky above at any time, so&hellip;</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of facing up:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Above you is bright sky.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;look toward [any adjacent room]&quot; as looking toward. Understand &quot;examine [any adjacent room]&quot; as looking toward.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Looking toward is an action applying to one visible thing.</div>

<div class="codeline">Carry out looking toward:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You make out [the noun] that way.&quot;</div>
</div><p>This design allows us to create descriptions for rooms (as seen from the outside) which will work regardless of where we&#39;re looking from. For instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of looking toward Athens:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Even from here you can make out the silhouette of the Acropolis.&quot;</div>
