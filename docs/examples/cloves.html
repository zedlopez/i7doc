<div class="example-body"><p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it&#39;s a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.</p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type &gt;GO WEST CAREFULLY or &gt;CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both. After reading a command is the best point to do this sort of thing, because we can find adverbs, interpret them, and remove them from the command stream. So:</p>
