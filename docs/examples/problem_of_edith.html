<p>Suppose that we have a core set of issues we want to be able to bring up with all the characters, and we want characters to draw intelligent connections between different conversation topics. We will need some model of how things relate to one another, so:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the current subject is the second noun.</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You contemplate [a list of things suggested by the current subject].&quot;</div>
</div><p>For that matter, we could use the same system to have characters make sense of any physical evidence the character shows them:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of showing something which suggests the current subject to someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The second noun] nods impatiently.&quot;</div>

</div><p>If we had more than one character in the scenario, we could provide multiple tables, but this will do to demonstrate the idea.</p>
