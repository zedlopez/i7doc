<p>There are two aspects of Inform&#39;s handling of pushable objects that are particularly prime for modification. One is that we may want to change the language used to refuse the pushing of unpushable objects.</p>
<p>Second, Inform by default assumes that it is impossible to push objects in up or down directions. This makes lots of sense if the player is trying to push a wheelbarrow up a ladder; it makes less sense if instead we&#39;re pushing a ball up a slope.</p>
<p>We solve both problems with some syntax borrowed from the chapter on rulebooks: in the first case, we replace the old rule with a new one with more friendly phrasing; in the second, we remove the rule entirely. More about how to do this is described in the rulebooks chapter; and in general we can find out what rules contribute to any given action by looking at the Actions index. In this case, the action is &quot;pushing it to&quot;, which has its own set of prerequisites (called check rules) that make sure the object can safely be pushed, before turning processing over to the going action.</p>
