<div class="example-body"><p>We&#39;ve simulated a deck of cards before, but only as entries in a table. This time we&#39;re going to do it more completely, with card objects that can be drawn and discarded, and referred to by name. The tedious way to do this would be to make 52 objects by hand and laboriously write out their names and understand rules.</p>
<p>A more sensible way is to make 52 identical card objects, assign them ranks and suits, and allow Inform to generate and parse their names automatically.</p>

</div><p>This is enough already to let inform understand things like &quot;ten clubs&quot;, but we want to add a couple of refinements. For one thing, we&#39;d like to accept &quot;of&quot; when it appears in phrases such as &quot;ten of clubs&quot; (but not generically otherwise); for another, we&#39;d like the player to be able to use various names for ranks. To this end, we need to borrow from the Activities chapter and modify the player&#39;s command before attempting to understand it:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player&#39;s command includes &quot;of [suit]&quot;:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while the player&#39;s command includes &quot;of&quot;:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;cut the matched text;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat through the Table of Value Names:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while the player&#39;s command includes topic entry:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the matched text with value entry.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[This allows Inform to understand &quot;ace&quot;, &quot;deuce&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, etc., as numerical ranks.]</div>
</div><p>It may be a bit confusing that the Table of Value Names has both a topic column and a term column, to all appearances essentially identical. But items in the topic column can be matched against the player&#39;s input, whereas items in other kinds of text column can be printed out; the two kinds of text are not treated identically by Inform, so we need to have both. Notice that the topic column contains entries like &quot;jack/knave,&quot; which will match either &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;knave&quot; in the player&#39;s input.</p>
<p>Now to set up the deck at the outset. With some intelligent looping, we avoid having to declare every combination of suit and number individually:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;reconstitute deck.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To reconstitute deck:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let current suit be hearts;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every card is in the card repository;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;while a card is in the card repository:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with current rank running from 1 to 13:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let item be a random card in card repository;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now rank of item is current rank;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now suit of item is current suit;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now item is in the deck of cards;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now current suit is the suit after the current suit.</div>
</div><p>And now we need a simple setting and some actions to manipulate the deck with:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 2 - The Deck and the Discard Pile</div><div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Empty Room is a room. &quot;Nothing to see here.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The deck of cards is in the Empty Room. It is a closed unopenable container. The description is &quot;A standard poker deck.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The discard pile is a closed unopenable container. The description is &quot;Cards in this game are discarded face-down, so the discard pile is not very interesting to see. All you can observe is that it currently contains [if the number of cards which are in the discard pile is less than ten][the number of cards which are in the discard pile in words][otherwise]about [the rounded number of cards which are in the discard pile in words][end if] card[s].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To decide what number is the rounded number of (described set - a description of objects):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be the number of members of the described set;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let R be N divided by 5;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let total be R times 5;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;decide on total.</div>
</div><p>The above phrase rounds a number to the nearest five, because it seems unrealistic for the player to be able to count a large number of cards in the discard pile at a single glance.</p>
<p>This next bit is an optional borrowing from the Activities chapter: we want to prevent Inform printing things like &quot;You can see a discard pile (closed) here.&quot;, since we don&#39;t want the player to think of the piles as containers, even though Inform thinks of them in those terms.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing room description details of something: do nothing instead.</div>
</div><p>Finally, we want the player to use &quot;draw&quot; and &quot;discard&quot; to manipulate his hand of cards:</p>
