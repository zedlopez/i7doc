<p>A fairly common effect in interactive fiction is a room which is described differently on the first visit than on subsequent visits. We can produce this effect as follows:</p>

</div></details><p>Note the &quot;[if unvisited]&hellip;&quot; in the description of the Slightly Wrong Chamber. A room is considered to be &quot;unvisited&quot; until after the player has seen its description for the first time.</p>
<p>The bracketed text creates a special rule for printing; we will learn more about these in the sections on text with variations and text with substitutions.</p>
<p>Some further fine print: we might write our condition as &quot;if unvisited&quot;, &quot;if the location is unvisited&quot;, or &quot;if the Chamber is unvisited&quot; &ndash; all of these constructions would be acceptable, but in the absence of more specifics, the condition is understood to apply to the object whose description it is.</p>
