The verb to stand means the height property. The verb to measure means the height property. A thing has a height. The height of a thing is usually 3 feet 0.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tiny if its height is 0 feet 6 inches or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is short if its height is 3 feet 0 or less.\n\nDefinition: a thing is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 or more.\n\nThe height of a man is usually 5 feet 10 inches. The height of a woman is usually 5 feet 6 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is monumental if it is taller than 25 feet 0 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is mentionable if it stands tall enough to see.\n\nTo decide whether (item - a thing) stands tall enough to see:\n\tif the item is in the Rose Garden and the item is shorter than the roses, no;\n\tif the item is mentioned, no;\n\tif the item is in an adjacent room and item is taller than 2 feet 0, yes;\n\tif the item is taller than 4 feet 0, yes;\n\tno.\n\nInstead of examining something which is within a room (called the space) which is not the location:\n\tif the location is adjacent to the space:\n\t\tif the noun is tiny, say &quot;It is too far from here for you to make out much detail about [the noun].&quot; instead;\n\t\tlet way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\t\tif the way is a direction, say &quot;You gaze off [way] at [the noun]...&quot;;\n\t\tcontinue the action;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tif the noun is short, say &quot;It is too far from here for you to make out much detail about [the noun].&quot; instead;\n\t\tlet way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\t\tif the way is a direction, say &quot;You gaze off [way] into the distance at [the noun]...&quot;;\n\t\tcontinue the action.\n\n\nWriting a distant paragraph about something is an activity.\n\nRule for writing a distant paragraph about the lily pond:\n\tif the second noun is a room and something mentionable is in the second noun, say &quot;A [lily pond], [chosen direction], patchily reflects [a list of mentionable things in the second noun] on the far side. [run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;To [the chosen direction], [a lily pond] shimmers in the sunlight. [run paragraph on]&quot;\n\nRule for writing a distant paragraph about the roses:\n\tif something in the Rose Garden is taller than the roses,\n\t\tsay &quot;Over the tops of [the roses], [chosen direction], you see [a list of mentionable things in the rose garden]. [run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;Immediately [chosen direction] is [the roses]. [run paragraph on]&quot;\n\nRule for writing a distant paragraph about the obelisk:\n\tif a mentionable thing in the Upper Terrace is shorter than the obelisk,\n\t\tsay &quot;A stupidly grand [obelisk], [chosen direction], towers over [a list of mentionable things in the Upper Terrace]. [run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;To [the chosen direction], you can&apos;t help noticing [the obelisk], which is much larger than any object really needs to be. [run paragraph on]&quot;.\n\nAfter writing a distant paragraph about something:\n\tincrement the count of sentences.\n\n\nRule for writing a paragraph about something tiny when the location is outdoors:\n\tif the location is the Gravel Circle,\n\t\tsay &quot;Abandoned in the gravel [is-are a list of unmentioned tiny things in the location]. [run paragraph on]&quot;;\n\totherwise say &quot;Half trampled into the grass, and easy to miss, [is-are a list of unmentioned tiny things in the location]. [run paragraph on]&quot;\n\nBefore doing something other than examining or approaching to something which is not within the location:\n\tif the player has the noun, continue the action;\n\tsay &quot;(first going over to [the noun])[line break]&quot;;\n\ttry approaching the noun;\n\tif the noun is not within the location, stop the action.\n\nUnderstand &quot;go toward/to/towards/near [something]&quot; or &quot;approach [something]&quot; as approaching.\n\nApproaching is an action applying to one visible thing.\n\nCheck approaching:\n\tif the player is in something, say &quot;You&apos;ll have to get up.&quot; instead;\n\tif the noun is within the location, say &quot;You&apos;re as close to [the noun] as you can get.&quot; instead;\n\tlet space be the location of the noun;\n\tif the space is not a room, say &quot;You don&apos;t quite see how to get there.&quot; instead;\n\tlet way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\tunless way is a direction,\n\t\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t see how to get over there from here.&quot; instead.\n\nTo head to (space - a room):\n\tlet the way be the best route from the location to the space;\n\tif the space is adjacent to the location,\n\t\ttry going way;\n\totherwise silently try going way.\n\nCarry out approaching:\n\tlet space be the location of the noun;\n\twhile the space is not the location:\n\t\thead to space.\n\n\nGoing state is a truth state that varies. Going state is false.\n\nCheck going:\n\tnow going state is true.\n\nThe description of a room is usually &quot;[if going state is true]You drift [noun] across the open lawn[direction relative to obelisk]. [end if]An absolutely phenomenal quantity of manicured turf stretches from where you stand in almost every direction.&quot;\n\nBefore reading a command:\n\tnow going state is false.\n\nTo say direction relative to obelisk:\n\tif obelisk is in the location:\n\t\tsay &quot;, as though drawn magnetically to the foot of the monument&quot;;\n\totherwise:\n\t\tlet way be the best route from the location to the Upper Terrace;\n\t\tif way is the noun, say &quot;, drawn towards [the obelisk]&quot;;\n\t\tif the way is the opposite of the noun, say &quot;, keeping [the obelisk] more or less at your back&quot;.\n\nChapter 3 - The Grounds\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tnow the left hand status line is &quot;Idyllic&quot;;\n\tnow the right hand status line is &quot; &quot;.\n\nThe Gravel Circle, the Ha-ha, the Sheep Field, the Open Lawn, the Croquet Ground, the Rose Garden, the Upper Terrace, the Middle Terrace, and the Lower Terrace are outdoors.\n\nThe Middle Terrace is north of the Lower Terrace and south of the Upper Terrace. The lily pond is fixed in place in the Middle Terrace.&quot;You [if going state is true]come to[otherwise]are at[end if] the north edge of a perfectly round lily pond, bordered with stones. Its surface patchily reflects [the marble anteater] on the south bank.&quot; A tent peg and a wilted orchid are in the Middle Terrace. The tent peg measures 0 feet 6. The orchid measures 0 feet 4.\n\nThe description of the Lower Terrace is &quot;[if going state is true]You climb [noun] up a small hillock[direction relative to obelisk][otherwise]You stand on a short, round, entirely artificial hillock[end if].&quot;\n\nThe marble anteater is a fixed in place thing in the Lower Terrace. The height of marble anteater is 6 feet 2 inches.&quot;A marble anteater stands on a pedestal at the top of the hill. In the bright sunlight the white marble makes a striking contrast with [the obelisk] in the distance.&quot; The description is &quot;The anteater is very much more than life-size.&quot;\n\nThe obelisk of black granite is a fixed in place thing in the Upper Terrace.&quot;Now that you are at the foot of it, you can properly appreciate the stupid immensity of the obelisk, pointing stonily at heaven.&quot; The height of the obelisk is 50 feet 0 inches. The description of the obelisk is &quot;It stands ridiculously tall, and has an inscription on the face.&quot;\n\nThe inscription is part of the obelisk. The height of the inscription is 0 feet 3 inches. The description of the inscription is &quot;You can&apos;t read the squirming, pointed letters, but they make you uneasy.&quot;.\n\nThe Gravel Circle is west of the Upper Terrace, northwest of the Middle Terrace, and north of the Croquet Ground. The description of the Gravel Circle is &quot;[if going state is true]You head [noun] until the lawn thins and[otherwise]Here the lawn[end if] gives way to a circle of raked gravel, which crunches pleasingly beneath you.&quot;\n\nInstead of going northwest in the Upper Terrace, try going north.\n\nThe Ha-ha is north of the Gravel Circle and northwest of the Upper Terrace. The description of the Ha-ha is &quot;[if going state is true]The land dips here so suddenly that you do not know the dip is there until you&apos;re in it; but it prevents livestock from crossing barriers, and that is the important thing[otherwise]You are at the base of a steep-sided depression, so the lawn continues north and south more or less at the level of your head[end if].\n\nThe tip of [the obelisk] is the only thing you can make out from this depression, off to the southeast.&quot;. North of the Ha-ha is the Sheep Field. In the Sheep Field is an animal called a black sheep. The black sheep stands 4 feet 3 inches.&quot;A black sheep grazes placidly nearby.&quot; The description of the black sheep is &quot;It reminds you of your Uncle Tim.&quot;\n\nBefore going from the Ha-ha:\n\tsay &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a scramble to get back up the side of the depression, and you keep slipping in the damp grass. But you manage at last.&quot;\n\nThe Rose Garden is  southwest of the Lower Terrace. The thicket of red roses is a fixed in place thing in the Rose Garden. The thicket stands 4 feet 2 inches.&quot;Heavy red roses grow over a roughly horseshoe-shaped wall around you. Over this barrier, the head of [the marble anteater] is visible to the northwest, and the tip of [the obelisk] in the distance.&quot;\n\nThe description of the Rose Garden is &quot;[if going state is true]You slip [noun] into the enclosure of the rose garden. [end if]The rest of the park, and the world, seems muted and quiet.&quot;\n\nInstead of smelling the rose garden: try smelling the roses. Instead of smelling the roses, say &quot;The smell tickles the back of your throat and makes you want to cough.&quot;\n\nInstead of listening to the rose garden:\n\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t hear anything at all.&quot;\n\nThe Open Lawn is north of the Rose Garden, west of the Lower Terrace, and southwest of the Middle Terrace. The Croquet Ground is north of the Open Lawn, west of the Middle Terrace, southwest of the Upper Terrace, and northwest of the Lower Terrace.\n\nA discarded champagne cork is in the Open Lawn. It stands 0 feet 2 inches.\n\nA stone bench is an enterable supporter in the Croquet Ground. It stands 3 feet 8 inches.&quot;There is a stone bench here -- a sort of stone sofa, really, with nymphs disporting themselves on the arms and back.&quot; The description of the bench is &quot;It used to be a Roman sarcophagus -- hence the nymphs -- but someone has thoughtfully recarved it as lawn furniture.&quot;\n\nThe half-size Bentley is a vehicle in the Gravel Circle.&quot;A sort of child&apos;s-toy version of a Bentley is parked [if something parkable is in the location]beside [the tallest parkable thing in the location][otherwise]close at hand[end if].&quot; The description of the half-size Bentley is &quot;Of beautiful and unambiguously luxurious lines, but sized down to hold only one or (at a stretch) two people, and powered by electricity.&quot; The half-size Bentley stands 3 feet 6 inches.\n\nDefinition: a thing is parkable if it is not a person and it is not the Bentley.\n\nInstead of touching the obelisk, say &quot;Though it is black stone in sunlight, the obelisk is very cold to the touch.&quot;\n\nTest me with &quot;look east / look toward obelisk / s / s / e / sw / ne / n / n / w / n / n / examine obelisk / touch obelisk / read inscription&quot;.`)">⧉</button><div class="codeline storytitle">&quot;Stately Gardens&quot;</div>
