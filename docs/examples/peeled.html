<p>Suppose we have a situation where the player is in darkness, but is allowed to feel and interact with (except for examining) any large objects.

<p>Alternatively, suppose we have a situation in which the player can use one command to interact with a kind of thing that isn&#39;t normally in scope. It&#39;s usually most convenient to write the &quot;understand&quot; rule appropriately rather than use the scope activity.</p>

More on this restriction may be found in the <a href="WI_12.html">Advanced Actions chapter</a> on the topic of visible, touchable, and carried things.)</p>
