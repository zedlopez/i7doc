<p>Suppose we have a cat which is supposed to react to (and destroy) the most interesting thing in its environment. There are several ways we could approach this problem, but for the sake of demonstration, let&#39;s have it follow a rulebook to figure out which thing it most wants to interact with. We will then return the chosen object as &quot;the object produced by the cat behavior rules&quot;.</p>
