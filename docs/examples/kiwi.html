<p>Suppose we want there to be some high shelves in our game, which the player can&#39;t get at unless he&#39;s standing on a prop of some kind. (This is a pretty hoary and over-used puzzle, but there may still be occasions when it becomes useful again.)</p>
<p>In order to resolve this, we want to set up a raised supporter kind. When something is on a raised supporter, it should be mentioned to the player only if the player is in the right position (i.e., standing on something) and otherwise omitted from the description entirely.</p>

<div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Procedure</div><div class="codeline">A raised supporter is a kind of supporter.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">For printing a locale paragraph about a raised supporter (called the high place):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is on a supporter (called the riser):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Up on [the high place] (and only visible because you&#39;re on [the riser]) [is-are a list of things on the high place].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The [high place] is above you.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Note that here we don&#39;t continue the activity because we want to completely replace the normal behavior of describing what is on supporters.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Definition: a thing (called target item) is out of reach:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is on a supporter, no;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the target item is on a raised supporter, yes;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;no.</div>
</div><p>Now we also need to prevent the player from interacting with things that are out of reach:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before doing something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is out of reach or the second noun is out of reach:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can&#39;t reach from down here.&quot; instead.</div>
</div><p>&hellip;or restoring things to the shelves while the player is in the wrong position&hellip;</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of putting something on a raised supporter when the player is not on a supporter:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can&#39;t reach from down here.&quot;</div>
</div><p>And raised supporters shouldn&#39;t be searchable from the ground either:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of searching or examining a raised supporter when the player is not on a supporter:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can&#39;t see from down here.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Finally, we need to tackle the case where the player types GET ALL FROM SHELF, because we don&#39;t want to list the objects up there if the player can&#39;t even see them. We use a rule for deciding whether all includes in order to tell Inform not to consider items that can&#39;t be reached, and then we adjust the parser error so that it&#39;s a little more instructive than &quot;There are none at all available!&quot;, which is what the response would otherwise be:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Disallowed-all is a truth state that varies. Disallowed-all is false.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for deciding whether all includes an out of reach thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now disallowed-all is true;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;it does not.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the nothing to do error and the player is not on a supporter:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if disallowed-all is true:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Whatever might be up there, you can&#39;t see or reach from down here.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;make no decision.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A first action-processing rule:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now disallowed-all is false.</div>
