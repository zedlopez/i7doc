<p>Inform automatically keeps track of light and darkness, handling such questions as whether a room is lit, whether the player can see any light sources, etc., and then managing the descriptions accordingly. When the room is dark and no light sources are visible, the player is said to be &quot;in darkness&quot;.</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t specify otherwise, Inform will describe our surroundings in a dark room thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Darkness</div>
<div class="codeline">It is pitch dark, and you can&#39;t see a thing.</div>
</div><p>This is fine in many situations, but we may sometimes want to replace this phrase with something else.</p>
