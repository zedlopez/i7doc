<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform&#39;s default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>

The description is &quot;Through it can be seen a slice of wooded hillside and exposed grey-brown cliff. You are in the southern French foothills of the Alps, and the territory is dry.

<div class="codeline i7header">Part 1 - Procedure</div><div class="codeline">A scene has a room called the starting location.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A scene has a list of objects called the scenery props.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A scene has a list of objects called the inventory props.</div>
</div><p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special &quot;When the Dancing-Lesson begins&hellip;&quot; rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don&#39;t. In particular any scene that starts &quot;when play begins&quot; should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A scene can be location-silent or location-loud.</div>
</div><p>And let&#39;s say that we also want to announce each new scene as another &quot;chapter&quot; of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include &quot;Basic Screen Effects&quot; because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.</div>

<div class="codeline">First when a scene (called the current scene) which is not the Entire Game begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if chapter counter is greater than 0:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment chapter counter;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[bold type]Chapter [chapter counter]: [current scene][roman type]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Last when a scene (called the current scene) which is not the Entire Game begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through the scenery props of the current scene:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the item to the starting location of the current scene;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through the inventory props of the current scene:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the item to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the location is not the starting location of the current scene:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the current scene is location-loud:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the player to the starting location of the current scene;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the player to the starting location of the current scene, without printing a room description.</div>
</div><p>At the end of each scene, we strike the set and remove all the loose objects from play.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">When a scene (called the current scene) ends:</div>
