<p>Suppose that we wanted authors to be able to indicate which relations should or should not be included in room descriptions, and have the system dynamically honor that instruction.</p>
<p>Inform already knows about verbs for describing supporting, containment, carrying, and wearing, so we could write a set of instructions to handle such cases. To do this, we&#39;re using the &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; activity, which is described in the <a href="WI_18.html">chapter on activities</a>.</p>
<p>The following uses what is, strictly speaking, a piece of internal machinery not really intended for public use: a variable called &quot;prior named object&quot; which keeps track of what noun other words should agree with. It is not safe to use this variable except to clear it: &quot;now the prior named object is nothing&quot;. In a few situations, this prevents glitches in adaptive text.</p>
