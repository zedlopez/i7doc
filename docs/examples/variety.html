<p>Verbs can be related to other things by relations. We&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s possible for a verb to &quot;mean&quot; a relationship. But we can also create a relation between verbs and actions. For instance, we can tell Inform that &quot;take&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, and &quot;acquire&quot; are all valid ways to describe the action of taking, and then allow it to pick a verb randomly to describe whatever action just occurred.</p>
