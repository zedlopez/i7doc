<p>Because we can invent our own adjectives (see the chapter on Phrases), we can make the conditions for a backdrop as simple or as complicated as we like.</p>
<p>In this scenario, we want the player to be able to take, move, and drop orange traffic cones to seal off one street or another. So we create our own &quot;accessible&quot; adjective as follows:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Definition: a road is accessible if the orange cones are not in it.</div>
</div><p>&hellip;and now</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">move the traffic backdrop to all accessible roads.</div>
</div><p>will tell the traffic backdrop where to appear.</p>

</div><p>That accomplishes everything we set out to do, but let&#39;s add a very simple puzzle to test it out with:</p>

</div><p>And finally, a couple of features from the Activities chapter to make the output more elegant:</p>
