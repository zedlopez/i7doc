<p>A tradition among Nethack-like computer games of the old school is that a player&#39;s death in a given place leaves a ghost behind to haunt subsequent players. Information about past lives is sometimes stored in a &quot;bones file&quot;, and in this example we do exactly that, for a grievously unfair little dungeon.</p>
<p>To begin with, the labyrinth itself. We create a kind of value to remember possible means of death in these tunnels, and we assign a coordinate position in some grid to each location. (We do this because grid positions can safely be stored in tables saved out to external files, whereas room names cannot &ndash; they represent data which changes each time we amend the source.)</p>

</div><p>And as compensation for these hazards:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline tablename">Table of Point Values</div><table>
<tr><td>item</td><td></td><td>score</td></tr><tr><td>silver bars</td><td>3</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>platinum pyramid</td><td>10</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>emerald</td><td>4</td><td> </td></tr></table>
<div class="codeline">Report taking an item listed in the Table of Point Values:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increase the score by the score entry;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;blank out the whole row.</div>
</div><p>We are now ready for the actual undertaking. The Table of Ghostly Presences holds up to twenty death notices, and is initially blank. Deaths are sequentially numbered, and this number is stored in the sequence column.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline tablename">Table of Ghostly Presences</div><table>
<tr><td>haunted position</td><td>score at death</td><td>turns at death</td><td>manner of death</td><td>sequence</td></tr><tr><td>a grid location</td><td>a number</td><td>a number</td><td>a demise</td><td>a number</td></tr></table>
<div class="codeline blankrows">with 19 blank rows.</div>
</div><p>As the story file starts up, we look to see if a ghosts file already exists. If one does, we load up the Table of Ghostly Presences with it: and if not, as will be the case the first time the player explores, we leave the table blank. We sort the table so that it has earlier deaths (lower sequence numbers) first.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The File of Ghosts is called &quot;ghosts&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">When play begins:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the File of Ghosts exists, read File of Ghosts into the Table of Ghostly Presences;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;sort the Table of Ghostly Presences in sequence order.</div>
</div><p>How will ghosts manifest themselves? Because this is only a small example, we will simply tell the player that he senses something. If several ghosts are present in the same place, the most aggrieved (that is, the most recent) is sensed first&hellip;</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After looking:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat through the Table of Ghostly Presences in reverse sequence order:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the haunted position entry is the coordinates of the location, say &quot;You sense the ghostly presence of an adventurer, [manner of death entry] with a score of [score at death entry] in [turns at death entry] turns.&quot;</div>
</div><p>(For instance, &quot;You sense the ghostly presence of an adventurer, buried by a rockfall with a score of 10 in 5 turns.&quot;) That just leaves the rule for bumping off the player. When the Table is full, and there are already 20 ghosts, the one who died longest ago (with the lowest sequence count) is eliminated, and his row blanked out. (This will always be row 1 since we sorted the table in sequence order on reading it in.)</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">To have the player (sticky end - a demise):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the new sequence number be 0;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat through the Table of Ghostly Presences:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let S be the sequence entry;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if S is greater than the new sequence number, let the new sequence number be S;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the new sequence number;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of blank rows in the Table of Ghostly Presences is 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;choose row 1 in the Table of Ghostly Presences;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;blank out the whole row;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;choose a blank row in the Table of Ghostly Presences;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the sequence entry is the new sequence number;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the manner of death entry is the sticky end;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the turns at death entry is the turn count;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the score at death entry is the score;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the haunted position entry is the coordinates of the location;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;write the File of Ghosts from the Table of Ghostly Presences;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the latest demise is the sticky end;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story saying &quot;You have been [latest demise]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>Strictly speaking we ought to worry that after 2,147,483,647 deaths, the sequence numbers would grow too large to store in a single value, and then the sequence of ghosts will be erratic. But it seems unlikely that anyone will play this example 2.1 billion times.</p>
