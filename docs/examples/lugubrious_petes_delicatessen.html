<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Supermarket is west of the Delicatessen Counter. Lugubrious Pete is in the Delicatessen. &quot;Lugubrious Pete, dolefully slicing meats and cheeses, serves at the counter.&quot; Alice, Beth, Gemma, Delia, and Eliza are women in the Supermarket.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The deli queue is a list of objects that varies.</div>
</div><p>Two processes compete here: one that fills the queue, the other which will empty it. The first process is the one which brings shoppers in to the counter, joining the back of the queue, which is where &quot;add &hellip; to &hellip;&quot; puts new entries by default:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every turn when a woman is in the Supermarket and a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds (this is the customer arriving rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let the customer be a random woman in the Supermarket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the customer is in the Delicatessen;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Supermarket, say &quot;[The customer] walks into the Delicatessen.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Delicatessen, say &quot;[The customer] comes in from the Supermarket, and [if the number of entries in the deli queue is 0]can&#39;t believe her luck. The counter is free![otherwise]resignedly queues behind [the deli queue].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;add the customer to the deli queue.</div>
</div><p>The competing process is the one which serves shoppers and thus gets rid of them again: unfortunately, it is slower. But Pete is fair if inefficient, and serves the customers in strict order of arrival. Each served customer is removed from the front of the list, and the others therefore all move up a place.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every turn when the number of entries in the deli queue is not 0 and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds (this is the customer being served rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let the customer be entry 1 of the deli queue;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Delicatessen, say &quot;Pete gives a droopy expression as he serves [customer], who nevertheless brightens and leaves.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Supermarket, say &quot;[customer] emerges cheerfully from the Delicatessen Counter, and goes about her regular shopping.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the customer is in the Supermarket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;remove entry 1 from the deli queue.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of waiting in the Delicatessen when the number of entries in the deli queue is not 0, say &quot;Time passes, for [deli queue] quite as much as for yourself.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;wait / wait / wait / east / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait&quot;.</div>
</div><details class="testme-output"><summary>Test me with "wait / wait / wait / east / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait".</summary><div class="testme-output">Supermarket<br>You can see Alice, Beth, Gemma, Delia and Eliza here.<br><br>&gt;(Testing.)<br><br>&gt;[1] wait<br>Time passes.<br><br>Eliza walks into the Delicatessen.<br><br>&gt;[2] wait<br>Time passes.<br><br>Gemma walks into the Delicatessen.<br><br>&gt;[3] wait<br>Time passes.<br><br>Delia walks into the Delicatessen.<br><br>&gt;[4] east<br><br>Delicatessen Counter<br>Lugubrious Pete, dolefully slicing meats and cheeses, serves at the counter.<br><br>You can also see Delia, Gemma and Eliza here.<br><br>Alice comes in from the Supermarket, and resignedly queues behind Eliza, Gemma and Delia.<br><br>&gt;[5] wait<br>Time passes, for Eliza, Gemma, Delia and Alice quite as much as for yourself.<br><br>Beth comes in from the Supermarket, and resignedly queues behind Eliza, Gemma, Delia and Alice.<br><br>&gt;[6] wait<br>Time passes, for Eliza, Gemma, Delia, Alice and Beth quite as much as for yourself.<br><br>&gt;[7] wait<br>Time passes, for Eliza, Gemma, Delia, Alice and Beth quite as much as for yourself.<br><br>&gt;[8] wait<br>Time passes, for Eliza, Gemma, Delia, Alice and Beth quite as much as for yourself.<br><br>&gt;[9] wait<br>Time passes, for Eliza, Gemma, Delia, Alice and Beth quite as much as for yourself.
</div></details><p>That completes the example, but here is a variation to show that queues need not empty from the front. The Deli already looks a pretty sexist establishment, with the customers all being women, but it is about to get a whole lot worse:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Modesty is a kind of value. The modesties are positively prim, buttoned up, modest, flirty, revealing and downright immodest. Every woman has a modesty. Alice is positively prim. Beth is downright immodest. Gemma is modest. Delia is flirty. Eliza is revealing.</div>
</div><p>We could then rewrite the service rule like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every turn when the number of entries in the deli queue is not 0 and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds (this is the customer being served rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let Pete&#39;s preference be the deli queue;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;sort Pete&#39;s preference in reverse modesty order;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let the customer be entry 1 of Pete&#39;s preference;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;let the first in line be entry 1 of the deli queue;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Delicatessen, say &quot;[if the customer is the first in line]Pete gives a droopy expression as he serves [the customer], who nevertheless brightens and leaves.[otherwise]Outrageously, Pete scans the queue, notices [the customer] in her [modesty of the customer] clothes, and serves her next, while [the first in line] glares at him.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is in the Supermarket, say &quot;[The customer] emerges cheerfully from the Delicatessen Counter, and goes about her regular shopping.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the customer is in the Supermarket;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;remove the customer from the deli queue.</div>
</div><p>It is now heartbreakingly difficult for Alice to obtain her sliced chorizo sausage.</p>
