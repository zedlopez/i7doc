<p>In a very dense environment, we might want to offer the player room descriptions in which only the currently-interesting items are mentioned, while other objects are suppressed even if they are present. In effect, this takes the idea of scenery and makes it more flexible: different things might become background objects or foreground objects at different times during play.</p>
<p>There are a wide range of possible reasons to do this -- to shift the narrative emphasis, to change the mood of the game by highlighting different parts of the environment, to show the game from the perspective of different viewpoint characters -- but in the following example, our goal is to show the player only the objects that are currently useful for puzzles.</p>
<p>To do this, we need some notion of what puzzles are currently available and unsolved, so we make an &quot;unsolved&quot; adjective; we also need to know which things solve the puzzle, so we create a &quot;resolving&quot; relation, to indicate which objects resolve which problems.</p>
<p>Given that information, we can create rules about which objects in the game world are currently interesting, which are currently dull, and describe accordingly:</p>
