<p>If we wanted to define a brand new verb that did affect a specific object, we might begin like this:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;x xylan / hydrolyze xylan / x xylose&quot;.</div>
</div><p>Of course, how our players will ever solve this problem is another question (especially if their biology and chemistry are both rusty). When adding entirely new commands to a game, it is often a good idea to provide as many ways of phrasing the command as possible; to drop hints about the correct phrasing within the game&#39;s text; or even to tell the player about the expanded command list in some documentation or help at the beginning of the game. So for instance we might also add</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;break down [something] with water&quot; or &quot;break [something] down with water&quot; as hydrolyzing.</div>
</div><p>And these lines will also provide syntax for our new command, without interfering with the previous syntax. It&#39;s also good to anticipate alternative (British or American) spellings. People&#39;s typing habits are hard to overcome, even if they know you are spelling the word the other way. It is probably best not to annoy them unduly. So:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;hydrolyse [something]&quot; as hydrolyzing.</div>
</div><p>Then some text in-game might offer a clue, subtle or (since this is an example) blunt:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of examining the player, say &quot;You&#39;re a drop of water, which means that you can break down certain chemicals!&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;break down [something]&quot; or &quot;break [something] down&quot; as hydrolyzing.</div>
</div><p>And finally, we could try adding instructions explicitly:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;help&quot; or &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;hints&quot; or &quot;instructions&quot; or &quot;info&quot; or &quot;about&quot; as asking for help. Asking for help is an action out of world. Carry out asking for help: say &quot;The following commands are understood, in addition to the standard ones: EVAPORATE, FREEZE, HYDROLYZE, SUBLIME...&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test more with &quot;help / x me / break down xylan&quot;</div>
</div><details class="testme-output"><summary>Test me with "x xylan / hydrolyze xylan / x xylose".</summary><div class="testme-output">Plant Cell Wall<br>You can see a xylan sample here.<br><br>&gt;(Testing.)<br><br>&gt;[1] x xylan<br>A polysaccharide. Totally useless. If only you had some xylose, instead!<br><br>&gt;[2] hydrolyze xylan<br>At once the xylan becomes xylose.<br><br>&gt;[3] x xylose<br>Awesome!
</div></details><p>&hellip;though of course in fact these other commands won&#39;t be available until we define them, too.</p>
<p>This last approach, defining all the extra commands up front, is especially useful if these commands are very technical or unusual; if they are needed early in the game, before you&#39;ve a chance to educate the player; or if they are not suggested by any in-game objects. A player who encounters a tool with an obvious use, such as a hairbrush, will likely think of trying to BRUSH things with it. It&#39;s harder to rely on his guessing actions that are both outside the range of usual commands and unrelated to any of the visible props, however.</p>
