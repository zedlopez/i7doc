<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose we want the player to see a modified room description when he&#39;s viewing the place from inside a vehicle. There are several conceivable ways of doing this; the example here shows a rather advanced way, but is very flexible and will let us write all sorts of special cases.</p>

</div><p>Here&#39;s the tricky part, which relies on material from the chapters on Activities and Rulebooks:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The container interior rule is listed before the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">This is the container interior rule:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the actor is the player and the player is in an enterable thing (called current cage), carry out the describing the interior activity with the current cage.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Describing the interior of something is an activity.</div>
</div><p>Now we&#39;ve done that, we can write a &quot;rule for describing the interior&quot; of something, which will print whatever we like:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for describing the interior of the hover-bubble:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The hover-bubble is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender.&quot;</div>
</div><p>In fact, as a special refinement, we could even say:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for describing the interior of the hover-bubble when the hover-bubble contains more than one thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The hover-bubble is transparent, but tints everything outside very faintly lavender. Beside you you can see [a list of other things in the hover-bubble].&quot;</div>
