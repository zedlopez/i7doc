<p>The range of things one might want to do with a rope in a work of interactive fiction is fairly overwhelming. One might, in theory, swing from ropes; use them to tie containers shut; cut them up into smaller ropes; tie them together into longer ropes; employ them as fuses; bind other characters with them, or the player character.</p>
<p>Our rope implementation is, by these lights, reasonably simple, but it does account for the possibility of tying and untying both ends; using ropes to descend into lower rooms; pulling objects tied to the far end of the rope; and dragging objects from place to place.</p>

An oak stump is fixed in place in the Field. &quot;From an oak stump, a few hopeful shoots grow.&quot; A hempen rope is a rope in the field. It is stuck to the oak stump and the wooden chest. The stump is unevenly shaped.\n\nThe Chasm is below the Field. &quot;Your person is most uncomfortably pressed on every side by the closeness of the walls; to which you may add as a further inconvenience, that the irregularity of the floor making it difficult to walk upright.&quot; An iron key is in the Chasm. &quot;An iron key nestles in the cleft of earth, its age indicated by its implausibly great size.&quot;\n\nThe wooden chest is a unevenly shaped closed openable container in the Chasm.

A staircase without banister ascends inside the wall to a musician&apos;s gallery without song.&quot;\n\nThe Musician&apos;s Gallery is above the Castle Hall. &quot;Of its former cheery aspect only this remains to the Gallery: that chevrons of red and yellow are painted on the wall. But as these are streaked with rain and grime, the banister pulled away, the roof open to the sky, and the corners made a nesting place for birds, the consolation thereby afforded is but slight.&quot;\n\nThe pointed door is north of the Musician&apos;s Gallery and south of the Sinister Attic. It is a closed locked openable door. &quot;A pointed door of particularly grim and uninviting aspect leads north.&quot; The pointed door is lockable and unevenly shaped.
