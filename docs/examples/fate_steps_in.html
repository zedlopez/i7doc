<p>One of the nice things about before rules for actions is that they allow us to express some planning for characters other than the player: we&#39;ve already seen how this works, a bit. But we could also use before rules to write plans for an abstract story-driving entity, rather than for other individual characters. This story-driver could be in charge of all the non-player characters, as well as spontaneous or natural changes in the environment, shaping the narrative around the player&#39;s behavior.</p>
<p>The following example is a very simple one, but the same concept could be worked out in a great deal more complexity, with all sorts of alternative procedures available to our story-manager:</p>
