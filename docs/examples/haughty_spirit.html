<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose we have a game in which the player can climb through windows which overlook rooms below. We want him to be allowed to climb out windows to reach a room on the same level or at most one level lower than the one he&#39;s on; otherwise, he should get a refusal, saying that he would break his neck.</p>
<p>To figure out the height distance between the start room and the destination room, we might have a repeat loop look at all the directions one has to follow along the &quot;best route&quot; path between the two rooms, and record any ups and downs; then subtract the number of &quot;up&quot; steps from the number of &quot;down&quot; steps, and report what remains.</p>
