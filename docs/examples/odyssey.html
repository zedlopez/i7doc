<div class="codeline">Athena is a woman in Athens.</div>
</div><p>Athena will proceed, unless delayed, through a list of locations stored in a simple table. Rather than using Inform&#39;s route-finding abilities (&quot;the best route from&hellip;&quot;), we simply move Athena from one location to the next, not even using the going action: she moves in mysterious ways, as befits a goddess.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline tablename">Table of Athena&#39;s Movement</div><table>

</div><p>By blanking out the table line by line, we make sure that we never lose our place in the path.</p>
<p>Since we want the player to be able to talk to Athena, we need a way to stall her in her path, as well.</p>

<div class="codeline">Before doing something to Athena:</div>
