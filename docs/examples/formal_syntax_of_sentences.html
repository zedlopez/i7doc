<p>An entire grammar for the whole mass of Inform would not be linguistically interesting: it contains many convenient wordings which are not really part of a grand pattern. Inform does, however, have a formal notion of a Sentence, a grammatical structure which we shall call S. It is almost true that conditions (&quot;if the flowerpot is on the wall&quot;) have the same grammar as assertions (&quot;The flowerpot is on the wall&quot;) and &quot;now&quot; phrases (&quot;now the flowerpot is on the wall&quot;). All three use the S grammar, so we could define an assertion as &quot;S.&quot;, say that &quot;if S&quot;, &quot;while S&quot;, &quot;when S&quot; and so on are conditions, and say that &quot;now S&quot; defines the &quot;now&quot; declaration.</p>
<p>Grammatical sentences do not necessarily make sense, of course. Many perfectly grammatical assertions in fact give rise to problem messages:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The wicker basket is not in the kitchen. (<em>Unhelpfully negative.</em>)</div>
<div class="codeline">The wicker basket has been in the kitchen. (<em>Talks about a time which never existed.</em>)</div>
<div class="codeline">The wicker basket is full. (<em>Full of what? Too vague.</em>)</div>
<div class="codeline">The wicker basket is the ginger cat. (<em>Demonstrably false.</em>)</div>
</div><p>Whereas the first three, at least, would be sensible as conditions. So saying that assertions are &quot;just like&quot; conditions is a little misleading: what they have in common is S, the underlying grammar they each use as a starting-point.</p>
<p>To define S, we break it up into subsidiary structures. The most important is the Description Phrase (DP), examples of which include &quot;the red basket&quot;, &quot;somewhere lighted&quot; and &quot;an empty open container&quot;. Clearly sentences include DPs, but they also include other ingredients. The general pattern used in Inform is very simple:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">1. S = DP + VP</div>
<div class="codeline">2. VP = Verb + DP</div>
</div><p>where VP is another structure, the Verb Phrase. For instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">S (The horseman wears a riding helmet)</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;= DP (The horseman) + VP (wears a riding helmet)</div>
<div class="codeline">VP (wears a riding helmet)</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;= Verb (wears) + DP (a riding helmet)</div>
</div><p>In that example, the Verb was the single word &quot;wears&quot;. More generally, Inform allows a Verb to include adverbs and prepositions, to be negated, and to come in any of four tenses, so the following are all valid examples of Verb in our grammar:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">wore</div>
<div class="codeline">carries</div>
<div class="codeline">is carried by</div>
<div class="codeline">had not been inside</div>
</div><p>Although we are not going through the definition of Description Phrases in detail, it is worth noticing how &quot;which&quot; and &quot;who&quot; behave:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">3a. DP = DP + which + VP</div>
<div class="codeline">3b. DP = DP + who + VP</div>
</div><p>Thus &quot;an open container which is in the Ballroom&quot; can be broken down as:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">DP (an open container) + which + VP (is in the Ballroom)</div>
</div><p>To understand compounds like &quot;something in a container&quot;, we have to invent a new grammatical structure for &quot;in a container&quot; and similar: let&#39;s call this a Relative Phrase (RP).</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">4. DP = DP + RP</div>
</div><p>Thus &quot;an open container in the Ballroom&quot; is DP (an open container) + RP (in the Ballroom). Relative Phrases have two different forms:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">5a. RP = Preposition + DP</div>
<div class="codeline">5b. RP = Participle + DP</div>
</div><p>so that &quot;in a container&quot; is an example of 5a. An example of 5b would be</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">RP (worn by Mr Darcy) = Participle (worn by) + DP (Mr Darcy)</div>
</div><p>That is nearly it, but not quite: we must go back to the &quot;almost&quot; in the statement above that assertions and conditions &quot;almost&quot; have the same grammar S. The difference arises from a curious irregularity in English called subject-verb inversion (see the <em>Oxford English Grammar</em> at 3.22F), whereby assertions can be reversed but not conditions. For instance,</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">In the Garden is a sunflower.</div>
</div><p>This does not follow the pattern S = DP + VP, because &quot;in the garden&quot; is not a DP: indeed, it is not a noun at all. To make sense of this sentence, Inform reverses it to &quot;A sunflower is in the Garden&quot;, which does indeed follow DP + VP. Hence the final rule:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">6 (assertions only). S = RP + Verb + DP</div>
</div><p>So the condition &quot;if in the garden is a sunflower&hellip;&quot; fails because rule 6 does not apply to the grammar for conditions: while occasional poetic uses of subject-verb inversion do turn up in conditions (&quot;If On A Winter&#39;s Night A Traveller&quot;, say), they are rare in ordinary English usage, and illegal in Inform. That completes the S grammar, so to recap:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">1. S = DP + VP</div>
<div class="codeline">2. VP = Verb + DP</div>
<div class="codeline">3a. DP = DP + which + VP</div>
<div class="codeline">3b. DP = DP + who + VP</div>
<div class="codeline">4. DP = DP + RP</div>
<div class="codeline">5a. RP = Preposition + DP</div>
<div class="codeline">5b. RP = Participle + DP</div>
<div class="codeline">6 (assertions only). S = RP + Verb + DP</div>
