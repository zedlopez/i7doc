</div></details><p>Notice the difference between the two rules about disorderly conduct: the one for other people says &#39;the rule succeeds&#39; to make sure that the action is counted as a success and not (as normally happens with instead rules) a failure. Most of the time we don&#39;t care whether actions are judged successes or failures, but it matters here, because if we type CHARLES, JUMP and the result fails, then text such as &#39;Charles is unable to.&#39; will be printed - which would get in the way. So we declare the action a success.</p>
