<div class="example-body"><p>By default, if we make no modifications, telling one player to give something to another will fail, even if persuasion succeeds. This is because the default behavior of the GIVE command is interrupted by the &quot;block giving rule&quot; -- since in many cases we do not want people to exchange objects freely.</p>
<p>However, suppose that we do want characters to be able to exchange articles freely: we allow persuasion to succeed and turn off the &quot;block giving rule&quot;.</p>
