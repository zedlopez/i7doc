<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is old if its last use is 12 or less.</div>
</div><p>The actual number chosen in this definition is pretty much irrelevant: the main thing is that we want to establish relative values. The lower the &quot;last use&quot; number of an item, the older that item should be understood to be, as we see here:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">To decide which thing is cyclically random (collection - a description of objects):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let choice be the oldest member of the collection;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the last use of the choice is the turn count;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;decide on choice.</div>
</div><p>This phrase will select, from the collection of objects passed to it, the one that has been mentioned least recently. This means that if we consult it repeatedly about the same collection, it will begin to cycle predictably; but if new items are added to the collection, it will mention these first before returning to the previous cycle. Now we can use this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After taking inventory:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You stare morosely at [the cyclically random thing carried by the player], wondering what you&#39;re ever going to find to do with it.&quot;</div>
</div><p>We could have said &quot;You stare morosely at [the oldest thing carried by the player]&quot; here, but doing so would not have set the &quot;last use&quot; property correctly, so we would not get the cycling behavior that we&#39;re looking for.</p>
