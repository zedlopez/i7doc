<p class="example-desc">What are activities good for? Controlling output when we want the same action to be able to produce very flexible text depending on the state of the world -- in this case, making highly variable room description and object description text.</p>
<div class="doc-navbar"><div class="doc-navbar-left"><a href="lakeside_living.html" title="Similar to &quot;Lemonade&quot;, but with bodies of liquid that can never be depleted, and some adjustments to the &quot;fill&quot; command so that it will automatically attempt to fill from a large liquid source if possible.">333.

<p>Suppose we want to create an object -- or maybe even a series of objects -- that warp the player&#39;s perception of every room description and object around him.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve already seen some ways to create variations in text. For instance, we could make a room description with if substitutions in it, like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Kitchen is a room. &quot;[if the player is wearing the sunglasses]Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably no.[otherwise]A small kitchen tucked into a corner of the vacation house. There is storage space for five or six cups, a sink, a two-ring stove; nothing else to speak of.[end if]&quot;</div>
</div><p>That works fine if we have one or two variations we want to add; it&#39;s not so good if we&#39;re going to have several items that work like the sunglasses, or if we want the sunglasses to override the description of every room in the house.</p>
<p>A slightly more flexible method is to use a substitution that calls out to a say phrase, like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Kitchen is a room. &quot;[kitchen-description]&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say kitchen-description:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is wearing the sunglasses:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably no.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;A small kitchen tucked into a corner of the vacation house. There is storage space for five or six cups, a sink, a two-ring stove; nothing else to speak of.&quot;</div>
</div><p>But again this doesn&#39;t handle the case of overriding multiple rooms at once very well.</p>
<p>When we reach a point where we need a given piece of text to be very flexible depending on the world model, it&#39;s time to use an activity.</p>
<p>Activities offer several advantages. One, we can create an activity like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Printing the room-description of something is an activity.</div>
</div><p>and then write a rule that applies to multiple rooms at once, like:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the room-description of a room when the player wears the sunglasses:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The walls look like they&#39;re covered with ants. Just a coincidence, I&#39;m sure.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Inform&#39;s usual rule-ranking also means that more-specific rules will override less-specific ones, so we could add</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;Rule for printing the room-description of the Kitchen when the player wears the sunglasses:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Are ants coming out of the sink? No, probably not.&quot;</div>
</div><p>and have that rule override the behavior of the activity just in the kitchen. Meanwhile, our base room descriptions remain straightforward and uncluttered by if-statements.</p>
<p>Several other examples will show how to hook activities into existing actions: Crusoe goes into detail about how how to make the descriptions of things more variable, and Aftershock demonstrates activities for describing the behavior of switchable devices.</p>
<p>Here, we preview all of those methods, just to get a sense of how they work and why they might be useful in controlling a game. Subsequent chapters go into more detail about the syntax of creating activities and the list of activities that are already defined by Inform.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline i7header">Part 1 - Procedure</div></div><p>To add a new activity to an existing Inform rule, we need to do three things:</p>
<p>1) Define our new activity.</p>
<p>2) Give a basic rule that says what is supposed to happen when that activity occurs, as in &quot;Rule for&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>3) Replace the existing rule in Inform&#39;s rulebooks with a new one that calls on our activity.</p>
<p>Here we do this with examining:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Item Description</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Printing the description of something is an activity.</div>
</div><p>Now, by default, we want to print the description property; we just want the option to write some extra rules overriding that property. So we tell Inform that our most basic rule for printing the description of something is just to give that description text:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for printing the description of something (called item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the description of the item is not &quot;&quot;:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[description of item][paragraph break]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You see nothing special about [the item].&quot;.</div>
</div><p>Next, we need the standard examining rule to look at our printing-the-description activity:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The activity-based examining rule is listed instead of the standard examining rule in the carry out examining rules.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">This is the activity-based examining rule:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;carry out the printing the description activity with the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;rule succeeds.</div>
</div><p>Now we do the same thing to room descriptions.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 2 - Room Description</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Printing the room-description of something is an activity.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for printing the room-description of a room (called item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the description of the item is not &quot;&quot;:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[description of item][paragraph break]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;do nothing instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The activity-based room description body text rule is listed instead of the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.</div>
</div><p>Our replacement rule this time around is a little bit trickier just because the rule that we&#39;re replacing is a complicated one: describing a room already checks to see whether there&#39;s light to see by, whether the player has turned off room descriptions when he enters a room for the second time, and whether the player character is (say) inside a closed box he can&#39;t see out of.</p>
<p>But all of those details are re-copied from the standard rules, and the important thing is that, at the end, we again carry out our activity.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">This is the activity-based room description body text rule:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the visibility level count is 0:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if set to abbreviated room descriptions, continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if set to sometimes abbreviated room descriptions and</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;abbreviated form allowed is true and</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;darkness witnessed is true,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;begin the printing the description of a dark room activity;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if handling the printing the description of a dark room activity,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;It is pitch dark, and you can&#39;t see a thing.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the printing the description of a dark room activity;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise if the visibility ceiling is the location:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if set to abbreviated room descriptions, continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if set to sometimes abbreviated room descriptions and abbreviated form</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;allowed is true and the location is visited, continue the action;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;carry out the printing the room-description activity with the location.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline i7header">Section 3 - Device Description</div><div class="codeline">Showing action of something is an activity.</div>
