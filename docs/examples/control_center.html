<p>It is straightforward to make a rule that anything with parts must mention all those parts during an EXAMINE command:</p>

<div class="codeline">After examining a thing when something is part of the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The noun] includes [a list of things which are part of the noun].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Control Center is a room. &quot;Here you are at the Control Center of the universe.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Universe Management Computer is a fixed in place thing in the Control Center. &quot;The Universe Management Computer sits directly before you, unguarded.&quot; The description of the Universe Management Computer is &quot;The computer is so large that you would be unable to operate it all from one position.

<div class="codeline">The command chair is an enterable supporter in the Control Center. It is pushable between rooms. &quot;Because the computer is too large for you to reach all of the front panel from a standing position, there is a command chair on casters which allows you to push back and forth.&quot; The description of the command chair is &quot;Quite ordinary, really, but for the heady rush of power that comes of sitting in it.&quot;. Some casters are part of the command chair.</div>
</div><p>Now whenever we look at any object with components, we will first see the description, then a list of parts which belong to it. The following refinement brings in elements of later chapters, but it may be worth noting: because we&#39;ve written our rule as an &quot;After examining&hellip;&quot;, anything that pre-empts the operation of the examine command will also prevent that rule from occurring. So for instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hair-thick needle is part of the ennui meter.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining the ennui meter: say &quot;You can&#39;t be bothered.&quot;</div>
</div><p>&hellip;would not result in the needle being mentioned.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;x chair / x computer / x ennui meter&quot;</div>
