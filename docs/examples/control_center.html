</div><p>Now whenever we look at any object with components, we will first see the description, then a list of parts which belong to it. The following refinement brings in elements of later chapters, but it may be worth noting: because we&#39;ve written our rule as an &quot;After examining&hellip;&quot;, anything that pre-empts the operation of the examine command will also prevent that rule from occurring. So for instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A hair-thick needle is part of the ennui meter.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining the ennui meter: say &quot;You can&#39;t be bothered.&quot;</div>
</div><p>&hellip;would not result in the needle being mentioned.</p>
