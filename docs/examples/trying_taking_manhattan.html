<p>Inform has built-in commands for other people, and sometimes we may want to adjust the way these work without completely disabling and replacing the command. Suppose, for instance, that instead of</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Kermit the Frog looks through his possessions.</div>
</div><p>we&#39;d like someone taking inventory to report what he&#39;s got, thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Kermit the Frog says, &quot;I seem to be carrying a microphone and wearing a hat and a trenchcoat.&quot;</div>
</div><p>To do this, we could replace the built-in report rule with a different one.</p>
