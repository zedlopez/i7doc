<p>The foregoing example moves the player one location towards his destination, and requires that rooms have been visited before. But suppose we wanted to be a bit more lenient about movement, and let the player make as many steps as necessary per turn. We will also show consideration about doors, using the &quot;Locksmith&quot; extension supplied with Inform. (Now every time the code attempts opening a door, unlocking rules will also be invoked.)</p>

</div></details><p>Notice that we continue the movement until one of two things happens: either the player reaches the room that is his destination, or the going attempt doesn&#39;t work. In the latter case we stop the action in order to avoid hanging the game up in a loop. This event might occur when the player runs into a locked door, for instance.</p>
