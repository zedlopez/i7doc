<div class="codeline">The window, the shelf and the bed are scenery in the Nook Obscure. The shelf and the bed are supporters. The bed is enterable.</div>

<div class="codeline">The box is an enterable supporter in Nook Obscure. The current box position is an internal position that varies. The current box position is near the bed. &quot;Your packing case, stamped W.

</div><p>We create an action, &quot;pushing it over to&quot;, for pushing a box around on the floor of a single location. (Calling this &quot;pushing it over to&quot; prevents clashes with the existing &quot;pushing it to&quot; action, which is for pushing things from one room to another.) Almost half of the text which defines the action is concerned with the two action variables, but they make the implementation of everything else so much easier that we end up writing less than if we hadn&#39;t used them.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;push [box]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;You can push the box to the window, the bed or the shelf.&quot;).</div>

<div class="codeline">Setting action variables for pushing something over to something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the old position is the current box position;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is the window, now the new position is over by the window;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is the bed, now the new position is near the bed;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is the shelf, now the new position is under the shelf.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check pushing it over to:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is not the box, say &quot;That&#39;s not something you can push.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is on the bed, say &quot;You can&#39;t reach from here.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player is on the noun, say &quot;Not while you are standing on [the noun].&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the new position is nowhere at all, say &quot;You can only push [the noun] to the window, the bed or the shelf.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the new position is the old position, say &quot;The [noun] is already [new position].&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out pushing it over to:</div>

<div class="codeline">Instead of taking something (called the item) which is on the shelf:</div>
