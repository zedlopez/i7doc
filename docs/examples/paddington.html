<p>Suppose we intend a game in which the player needs to cut things open on a regular basis. We&#39;ll want to check whether he has the proper tools handy, and deal graciously with commands such as CUT [something] when no tool is specified. So:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A blade is a kind of thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;cut [something] with [something]&quot; as cutting it with.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of cutting something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if a blade (called the edge) is held by the player,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try cutting the noun with the edge;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;otherwise say &quot;Your fingernails are not sharp enough.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Cutting it with is an action applying to two things.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check cutting it with:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is a person, say &quot;That would hurt.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is not a blade, say &quot;[The second noun] has not got enough of a blade.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out cutting it with:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;increment the count of rips of the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report cutting it with:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You slash [the noun] with [the second noun].&quot;</div>
</div><p>We&#39;ll need a way to account for all these cuts and rips.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is ripped if the count of rips of it &gt; 0.  A thing has a number called the count of rips. After examining something ripped, say &quot;You see [the count of rips of the noun in words] rip[s] in [the noun][if something is in the noun], revealing [a list of things in the noun][end if].&quot;</div>
</div><p>Moreover, because open containers normally list their contents when examined but we&#39;d prefer Paddington&#39;s to be mentioned in the ripping paragraph:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The examine containers rule does nothing when examining the teddy bear.</div>
</div><p>So far, so good. But suppose that we&#39;d like cutting also to make containers be permanently open and impossible to close again. We could write an &quot;instead&quot; rule, but that would mean that only our instead instructions would take effect, overriding the normal cutting it with rules entirely. Better would be to add a second carry out rule:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out cutting a container with something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the noun is open;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the noun is unopenable.</div>
</div><p>Now our rule will occur whenever a container is cut, but play will still go on to the reporting stage. And indeed we can add more of these, of varying degrees of specificity:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out cutting something which is part of something with something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;move the noun to the player.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out cutting the quilt with something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the description of the quilt is &quot;Horribly tattered.&quot;</div>
</div><p>For that matter, we might want to add a report rule as well, to occur after the &quot;You slash&hellip;&quot; rule, so that every time the player cuts something open which has contents, the contents will be listed.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Report cutting it with:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is open and the noun contains something,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Visible within [is-are a list of things in the noun].&quot;</div>
</div><p>This time we do not add the condition to the rule (i.e., Report cutting an open noun&hellip;) If we did, this report rule would be more specific than the general report rule, and would occur first.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Safehouse is a room.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The teddy bear is a closed thing in the Safehouse. The description is &quot;Fluffy[if the head is part of the bear], with an outsized head[otherwise], but headless[end if].&quot; The head is a closed part of the teddy bear. In the bear is a large wad of stuffing. In the head are a small wad of stuffing and a packet of smuggled diamonds.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The quilt is in the Safehouse. The description is &quot;An old but comforting quilt.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player carries a blade called a switchblade.</div>
</div><p>Here is a final nicety to get rid of the &quot;which is closed&quot; statement on our closed unopenable teddy bear, using an &quot;activity&quot; rule:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After printing the name of a closed unopenable container:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;omit contents in listing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;cut quilt with bear / cut quilt with switchblade / examine quilt / cut bear with switchblade / again / examine bear / cut head with switchblade / get diamonds / mourn loss of innocence&quot;.</div>
