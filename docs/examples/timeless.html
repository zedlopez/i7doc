<div class="codeline">Examining something is acting fast. Looking is acting fast.</div>
</div><p>Now we need a rule which, just at the right moment, stops the turn sequence rulebook in the cast of our new fast-acting actions:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The take visual actions out of world rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">This is the take visual actions out of world rule: if acting fast, rule succeeds.</div>
</div><p>Thus the rest of the turn sequence rulebook is omitted for looking or examining: in effect, they become out-of-world actions like &quot;saving the game&quot;. If we wanted to add, say, taking inventory to the list of instant activities, we would just need to define it as acting fast, too.</p>
