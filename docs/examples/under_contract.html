<div class="codeline">A persuasion rule for asking Clark to try taking off the pants:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;He gives you a look of mocking exasperation. Apparently you&#39;ll have to take a (slightly) more subtle approach.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;persuasion fails.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Check someone giving something to someone (this is the can&#39;t give worn items rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the person asked wears the noun, stop the action.</div>
</div><p>And because we do not want Clark automatically taking off the pants as the result of a drop action:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of Clark taking off the pants: do nothing.</div>
</div><p>We know that this can only come about as a default action, because we have arranged matters so that he cannot be persuaded directly.</p>
