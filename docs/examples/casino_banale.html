<div class="example-body"><p>In a work of interactive fiction that involves many new discoveries, we might want to change the way we narrate room descriptions and describe objects as the player learns new information.</p>
<p>One approach to this is to create a model of the facts we want the player to find out, and attach some narrative text to each. When a fact becomes relevant to the story, that narrative text is shown to the player. So:</p>

<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Procedure</div></div><p>First we create the concept of facts, and the idea that facts can make some things more important than others.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A fact is a kind of thing. A fact can be known or unknown. A fact can be ready to learn or hidden. A fact has some text called the narration.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is narratively significant if it conveys an interesting fact.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is narratively dull if it is not narratively significant.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Conveyance relates various things to various facts. The verb to convey means the conveyance relation.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a fact is interesting if it is unknown and it is ready to learn.</div>
</div><p>Now, we also need a way to tell Inform to introduce certain new facts when the right previous ones have been introduced. We&#39;ll create a &quot;following&quot; relation, according to which a new fact can be told to the player when the player has already learned all the facts it follows. This way, we can simulate the effect of putting together several pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Following relates various facts to various facts. The verb to follow means the following relation.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To say (new fact - a fact):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[narration of the new fact]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the new fact is known;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with possible outcome running through facts which follow the new fact:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if every fact which is followed by possible outcome is known:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the possible outcome is ready to learn.</div>
</div><p>Next we need a way for the game to introduce these new facts. Let&#39;s say we want them to come up when the player examines something appropriate, or sees it in the room:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After examining something which conveys an interesting fact (called discovery):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[discovery][paragraph break]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After choosing notable locale objects:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat through the Table of Locale Priorities:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the notable-object entry is narratively significant:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;set the locale priority of the notable-object entry to 1.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">For writing a paragraph about a narratively significant thing (called item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the item is mentioned;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let chosen fact be a random interesting fact which is conveyed by the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[chosen fact][paragraph break]&quot;.</div>
</div><p>The &quot;after choosing notable locale objects&quot; line here handles things so that any interesting conclusions we want to draw are always given first, followed by the less interesting description.</p>
<p>And finally, we need to give the player a little evidence to piece together:</p>
