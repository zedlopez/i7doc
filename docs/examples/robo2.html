<p>We have seen how we can make a robot that watches the player, then plays back the same actions again. A slightly more adventurous implementation would be to let the player create a whole series of named scripts which the robot will run on command.</p>
<p>To do this, we&#39;ll need each program to have a command that sets it off (stored as text, since this is the best way to capture and preserve arbitrary text entered by the player) and then the script of actions that must result:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;continue the action.</div>
</div><p>Of course, we also need to be able to switch learning mode off, and store any script learned this way. We&#39;ll also use the same STOP command to make Robo terminate a program he&#39;s in the middle of running.</p>

</div><p>Next, we need to be able to play these programs back again. We&#39;ll give Robo a &quot;current program&quot; to store which program he&#39;s currently working on, and a number called &quot;stage&quot; which will record where he is in the script. Our previous implementation simply had Robo erase entries from his script list as he performed them, but this time we would like Robo to be able to remember and rerun the same scripts over and over, so we need something a little more subtle.</p>

</div></details><p>We could also have written this so that Robo learns new scripts by accepting the player&#39;s instructions, so that</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&gt;ROBO, LEARN LIBRARY THEFT</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt;ROBO, TAKE BOOK</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt;ROBO, EAST</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt;ROBO, STOP</div>
</div><p>&hellip;would store the script &#39;library theft&#39; with the actions taking the book and going east. The implementation there would have been mostly identical, except that instead of an &quot;after doing something&hellip;&quot; rule, we would have captured commands as we asked Robo to perform them, and added those to the command list in progress. The alternative code might look something like this:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before Robo doing something other than stopping when Robo is watching:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;add the current action to the current instruction set;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;&#39;CHECK: [current action] added to script,&#39; says Robo.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Unsuccessful attempt by Robo doing something when Robo is watching:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;He does not actually perform the action.&quot;</div>
