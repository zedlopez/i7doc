Whistling chirpily, Alison brings it in and sets it down smack on [the next victim], then goes back out.&quot;;\n\t\trule succeeds.\n\n\nSection 6 - General Assessment\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif some of the things are concerned, say &quot;You sense some resentment from [the list of concerned things].&quot;\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif the player is carrying more than one scalding thing:\n\t\tlet the dropped item be a random scalding thing carried by the player;\n\t\tsay &quot;You can&apos;t hang onto so many burning hot things, and lose your grip on [the dropped item].[line break]&quot;;\n\t\tsilently try dropping the dropped item.\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tif almost all of the supporters are concerned,\n\t\tsay &quot;&apos;I hope everything is going well,&apos; bellows Alison from the other room.&quot;\n\n\nSection 7 - Scoring\n\nAn every turn rule:\n\tnow score is 5 minus the number of concerned things;\n\tif the location is concerned, decrement the score;\n\tif all of the supporters are concerned and the location is concerned, end the story;\n\tif none of the supporters are concerned and the location is not concerned, end the story finally.\n\nThe maximum score is 5.\n\nWhen play begins, now score is 4.\n\nTest me with &quot;i / take off left shoe / get the glass / put the glass on the platter / get the tile / drop the tile / get the kettle / put the kettle on tile / sit on the blue armchair&quot;.`)"><span class="sym">⧉</span></button><div class="codeline storytitle">&quot;Revenge of the Fussy Table&quot;</div>
