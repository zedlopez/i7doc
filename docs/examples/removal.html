<p>Suppose that we want to change the reporting of &quot;take&quot; so that the player is always told something like &quot;You take the book from the shelf.&quot; or &quot;You pick up the toy from the ground.&quot; In order to generate these reports, we will need to know where the object started, even though by the time we are printing the output, the object will have moved.</p>
