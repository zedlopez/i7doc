<div class="example-meta-desc"><p>In this fiendishly difficult puzzle, which may perhaps owe some inspiration to a certain BBC Radio panel game (1967-), a list is used as a set of actions to help enforce the rule that the player must keep going for ten turns without hesitation, repetition, or deviating from the subject on the card.</p></div>

<div class="example-body"><p>There is very little to this, in fact. The tricky rule to enforce is Repetition: the player is forbidden to repeat any previously tried action. We keep track of this by keeping a set of past actions, which for want of a better term is called the &quot;tally&quot;. All we need to do is:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">if the current action is listed in the tally, challenge for &quot;Repetition of [the current action]!&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">otherwise add the current action to the tally.</div>
</div><p>Note that the tally can never contain duplicates, and that when, at the end of the round, we print it out, we sort it first &ndash; this makes a more natural-looking sentence. (Sorting a list of actions uses the natural order for actions: compare the sequence on the Actions page of the Index.) The full text, then, is:</p>
