<p>Suppose we have a series of items that might be stacked on top of one another -- say a heavy television on a rolling cart, and we want the player to be able to move the cart with PUSH TELEVISION EAST just as well as with PUSH CART EAST.</p>
<p>This takes a little redirection, using a setting action variables rule. This is not a kind of rule we&#39;ve encountered yet, and in fact we won&#39;t meet it until the <a href="WI_12.html">Advanced Actions chapter</a>; it is included here for the convenience of authors who want to modify the effect of pushing without reading that far ahead:</p>
