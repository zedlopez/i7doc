<p>Using the compass directions in commands is a little bit finicky because directions are forbidden to figure in any interactions involving touch. (Really, directions are more a concept than an object; this is a compromise situation.) In any case, if we want to write a new command involving these, we need to be sure to specify that the direction is a visible thing. For instance:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&quot;Eddystone&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Lighthouse is a room. &quot;A lonely place, but in these tense times, no one but the lighthouse keeper and a few trusted agents are allowed on the grounds at all, for fear of sabotage.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The light is a fixed in place thing in the Lighthouse.  &quot;At the center of the room is the light itself, a 1000-Watt tungsten halogen light powered by diesel generator, and having a visible range of twenty-six nautical miles.&quot; Understand &quot;lamp&quot; as the light. It is lit. The light has a a direction called heading. The heading of the light is north.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
