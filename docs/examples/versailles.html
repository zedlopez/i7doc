<p>One of the advantages of descriptions is that we can use them to pick an item randomly from a specified category. (For more on this possibility, see the Change chapter sections on randomness.)</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we wanted to create a mirror in which the player would see some item from the room reflected. We might write</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of searching the mirror:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You see [a random thing in the location] reflected back at you.&quot;</div>
</div><p>This is the same as &quot;a random thing which is in the location&quot;: phrase &quot;in&hellip;&quot; can be used briefly in Inform as it can in English.</p>
<p>But, on a little more thought, we might want to expand on this: the mirror perhaps should reflect not only things that are in the room, but anything that the player can see (even if it&#39;s on a supporter or carried by someone). So then we might instead write</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of searching the mirror:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You see [a random visible thing] reflected back at you.&quot;</div>
</div><p>There&#39;s still a risk, though, that this will produce the response</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">You see the mirror reflected back at you.</div>
</div><p>because, of course, the mirror is itself visible. So instead we might write</p>

</div></details><p>A final note: we use &quot;searching&quot; here because Inform understands both SEARCH THING and LOOK IN THING as the searching action, and the player is most likely to type LOOK IN MIRROR in order to see the reflection there. In the absence of an example, we can discover the relationship between actions and their command vocabulary in one of two ways. A complete list of actions and the vocabulary associated with them is available in the Actions index. Alternatively, we can type ACTIONS at a prompt, followed by LOOK IN MIRROR, and get the response</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">[searching the mirror]</div>
<div class="codeline">You find nothing of interest.</div>
<div class="codeline">[searching the mirror - failed the can&#39;t search unless container or supporter rule]</div>
</div><p>&hellip;which tells us that Inform is understanding the action as &quot;searching the mirror&quot;.</p>
