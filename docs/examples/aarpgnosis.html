<p>Suppose we have a complete Encyclopedia in our game. The player is allowed to pick up the whole set (there must not be too many volumes), but also to do things with individual volumes, and indeed to scatter these volumes all over the place. Putting a volume back in the same place as the rest of the Encyclopedia should, however, restore it to the collective. We will start out by defining general rules for collectives like this:</p>

<div class="codeline">Fitting relates various things to one thing (called the home). The verb to fit means the fitting relation. Definition: a thing is missing if it is not part of the home of it.</div>

<div class="codeline">Before doing something to something which is part of a collective:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let space be the holder of the home of the noun;</div>

</div><p>Now the real work begins. One reason to make this an activity is that we might easily want to override it for specific objects; for instance, the generic collecting activity here would not deal properly with collectives of clothing where some items might be worn and others not. In that case, we would want to write another, more specific &quot;collecting&quot; activity to handle the complexities of fashion.</p>
