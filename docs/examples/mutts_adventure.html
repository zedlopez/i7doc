<p>Suppose we want to reward the player the first time he reaches a given room. The &quot;unvisited&quot; attribute is useful for this: unlike such constructions as &quot;going to a room for the first time&quot;, it doesn&#39;t develop false positives when the player has merely tried to go to the room in question. &quot;Every turn when the player is in a room for the first time&quot; is also unhelpful, because it continues to be true as long as the player is in a room on his first visit there.</p>
