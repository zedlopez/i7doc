<p>Suppose we&#39;re particularly mechanically-minded and would like a game in which all of our mechanical devices have buttons to turn them on and off.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">An on/off button is a kind of thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of pushing an on/off button which is part of a switched off device (called the machine):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try switching on the machine.</div>
</div><p>Here we are making a rule about how our hypothetical buttons will interact with the machines to which they belong. Instead of pushing&hellip; is a rule that pertains to actions, and we will learn more about these in the chapter on actions. &quot;&hellip;which is part of a switched off device&quot; provides a specific circumstance &ndash; this is only to apply to buttons that are stuck to a machines that can be turned on or off. &quot;(called the machine)&quot; tells Inform that if it finds such a device, it should thereafter refer to it as &quot;the machine.&quot; (The called syntax is explained further in the chapter on Change.)</p>
<p>A set of three more rules will complete our instructions about using buttons to control devices:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of pushing an on/off button which is part of a switched on device (called the machine):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try switching off the machine.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of switching on an on/off button which is part of a device (called the machine):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try switching on the machine.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of switching off an on/off button which is part of a device (called the machine):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try switching off the machine.</div>
</div><p>Then we hand out buttons with a free hand:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">One on/off button is part of every device.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Model Shop is a room. A model train is a fixed in place device in the Model Shop. A toy elephant is a device in the Model Shop.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the model train is switched on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The model train circles your feet, blowing small puffs of steam.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Every turn when the toy elephant is switched on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The toy elephant waves its trunk at you.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;push model train&#39;s button / push elephant&#39;s button / g / switch off model train&#39;s button&quot;.</div>
</div><p>And now the game will have a model train&#39;s button and a toy elephant&#39;s button.</p>
<p>It may be that we want (as an added nuance) to add other names for these items. While we would want an assembly to create objects such as &quot;Lucy&#39;s hand&quot; and not &quot;Lucy hand&quot;, it is entirely reasonable to want to talk about the model train button or the elephant button. We could define these additional names like so:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;elephant button&quot; or &quot;button on elephant&quot; as the elephant&#39;s button.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;model train&quot; or &quot;model&quot; or &quot;train&quot; as &quot;[train]&quot;. Understand &quot;[train] button&quot; or  &quot;button on [train]&quot; as the model train&#39;s button.</div>
</div><details class="testme-output"><summary>Test me with "push model train's button / push elephant's button / g / switch off model train's button".</summary><div class="testme-output">Model Shop<br>You can see a model train and a toy elephant here.<br><br>&gt;(Testing.)<br><br>&gt;[1] push model train&#39;s button<br>You switch the model train on.<br><br>The model train circles your feet, blowing small puffs of steam.<br><br>&gt;[2] push elephant&#39;s button<br>You switch the toy elephant on.<br><br>The model train circles your feet, blowing small puffs of steam.<br><br>The toy elephant waves its trunk at you.<br><br>&gt;[3] g<br>You switch the toy elephant off.<br><br>The model train circles your feet, blowing small puffs of steam.<br><br>&gt;[4] switch off model train&#39;s button<br>You switch the model train off.
</div></details><p>In the second case, we are defining [train] to mean any of the three phrases &quot;train&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, and &quot;model train&quot;; so &quot;[train] button&quot; will match &quot;model train button&quot; or &quot;train button&quot; or &quot;model button&quot; equally well. See the chapter on Understanding for more on how to create alternative phrasings for the player to use.</p>
