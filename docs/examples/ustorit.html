<p>Suppose we want to write a game in which there are a number of chests. Each of these chests will be a container, but have a lid which is a supporter.</p>

<div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Assemblies and Supporters</div><div class="codeline">A chest is a kind of container. A chest is always openable. A chest is usually fixed in place. A chest is usually closed. The specification of a chest is &quot;Represents a container with a separately implemented lid; the lid is itself a supporter.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A lid is a kind of supporter. A lid is part of every chest. The specification of a lid is &quot;A supporter attached to a chest, which can only support things when the chest is closed.&quot;</div>
</div><p>(The &quot;specification&quot; of a kind is not really a property, and is used instead to describe the kind in the Index. So the text of these specifications is never found in the game.) Of course, this doesn&#39;t get us very far. We will also want the game to correctly interpret variations on &quot;open the chest&quot; and &quot;close the lid&quot;, redirecting actions appropriately.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 2 - Opening and closing</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before opening a lid which is part of a chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try opening the item instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before closing a lid which is part of a chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try closing the item instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before opening a chest (called the box) when something is on a lid (called the obstruction) which is part of the box:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through things on the obstruction:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;(first removing [the item])&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try taking the item.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of opening a chest when something is on a lid (called the item) which is part of the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You&#39;d have to remove [the list of things on the item] from the lid first.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of looking under a lid which is part of a chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try opening the item.</div>
</div><p>We may also want to be able to deal with &quot;put in&quot; and &quot;put on&quot; appropriately, even if the player names the wrong part of the object:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 3 - Insertion and Support</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before inserting something into a lid which is part of a chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try inserting the noun into the item instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before putting something on a chest when a lid (called the item) is part of the second noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try putting the noun on the item instead.</div>
</div><p>Furthermore, we don&#39;t want the player to be able to put things on the lid while the chest is open:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before putting something on a lid which is part of an open chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;(first closing [the item])&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;try closing the item.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of putting something on a lid which is part of an open chest (called the item):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The item] would need to be closed first.&quot;</div>
</div><p>And then we may also want a couple of rules for describing our assembled object nicely:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 4 - Description in Rooms</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining a closed chest when something is on a lid (called the top) which is part of the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The noun] is closed, and there [is-are a list of things on the top] on top.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After printing the name of a chest (called the item) while listing contents of a room:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if a lid (called the second item) which supports something is part of the item:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot; (on which [is-are a list of things on the second item])&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;omit contents in listing.</div>
</div><p>Now we are free to create entire treasure rooms at a single blow:</p>

</div><p>Even though we have never explicitly defined it, the metal box has a &quot;metal box&#39;s lid&quot;, which we can use at need.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The metal box&#39;s lid supports a small card. The description of the small card is &quot;It reads, &#39;Back in 5 mins - Pandora.&#39;&quot;</div>
