<div class="codeline">Thames Street End is a room.</div>
</div><p>If we check out a map of historic Port Royal, we find that Thames Street End bends around the northwest tip of the peninsula and becomes the (very) roughly north/south Fisher&#39;s Row. We can&#39;t put Fisher&#39;s Row south of Thames Street End, though, because Lime Street is already going that way. So instead, let&#39;s have a map connection that bends around from west to north:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">West of Thames Street End is north of Fisher&#39;s Row.</div>
</div><p>Now continuing west along Thames Street, or north along Fisher&#39;s Row, will bring us around the corner in question. Asymmetric map connections should be used carefully. They&#39;re good for representing the layout of the real world, which tends not to be laid out on a convenient square matrix, but if exits are not described clearly they can be disorienting for the player. So let&#39;s be sure to make things clear:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The description of Fisher&#39;s Row is &quot;A waterfront street that runs south towards Chocolata Hole, where the small craft are harboured. It also continues north around the tip of the peninsula from here, turning into the east-west Thames Street.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Meanwhile, suppose Fort James is in a prominent position, raised a bit from its surroundings; maybe the player should be able to go down from there, as well as south, to get to Thames Street End.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Thames Street End is down from Fort James. Thames Street End is south from Fort James.</div>
</div><p>But we don&#39;t want the upward direction to work:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Up from Thames Street End is nowhere.</div>
