<p>Inform&#39;s default handling of wearable things does not make any rules about what can be worn together. Suppose, however, we have a game in which there are a large number of different garments, and we want to keep the player from wearing (say) more than one pair of pants at once:</p>

A more complicated treatment might keep track of layering and describe the player&#39;s outfit differently depending on which clothes were outermost -- an example for a later chapter.</p>
