The felt door is a door. The felt door is open. The felt door is lockable and unlocked. The key to the city unlocks the felt door.

The description of Nancy Johnson Memorial Square is &quot;Waves of August heat rise from the pavement: more than once you&apos;ve had the fancy that your shoes are simply going to stick. At the center of the square, rubbed to a brownish polish by many adoring hands, is the statue of Mrs. Nancy Johnson of New Jersey.&quot;\n\nThe statue is scenery in Memorial Square. Understand &quot;nancy&quot; or &quot;johnson&quot; or &quot;mrs&quot; as the statue.

Report inserting something into the slot: say &quot;[The noun] falls out of sight, and you know you will never see it again.&quot;\n\nHamwi Street is northeast of an iron gate. &quot;A U-shaped street running from Main Street around to the Memorial Square, Hamwi Street was recently added by ambitious city planners. The small and straggly line of trees has yet to grow enough to provide perceptible shade, so the street is even hotter and more unforgiving than the other parts of town.&quot;\n\nThe iron gate is northeast of Nancy Johnson Memorial Square. The iron gate is a door. It is lockable and unlocked.\n\nBefore printing the name of the iron gate while not opening or closing or locking or unlocking:\n\tif the person asked is the player:\n\t\tif the gate is open, say &quot;open &quot;;\n\totherwise if the gate is locked:\n\t\tsay &quot;locked &quot;;\n\totherwise if the gate is closed:\n\t\tsay &quot;closed &quot;.\n\nCold Comfort Ice Cream is north of a metal door.

Durian, jackfruit, taro, and coconut flavors!&quot;\n\nThe metal door is a door. &quot;A frosty metallic door separates [the location] from [the other side of the metal door].&quot; The metal door is lockable and unlocked. The key to the city unlocks the metal door.\n\n\nMarciony Street is southeast of Nancy Johnson Memorial Square. &quot;A semi-circular terrace, named somewhat fancifully after one claimant to the invention of the ice cream cone -- though Hamwi Street competes for the same honor. There are wedges of cool shadow here and there thanks to the buildings, but for the most part the southern exposure keeps Marciony unpleasantly hot.&quot;\n\nThe Movie Rental Store is west of a glass door. The glass door is a door. It is west of Marciony Street.  The glass door is lockable and unlocked. The key to the city unlocks the glass door.\n\nMain Street is southeast of Hamwi Street.

The emergency box is fixed in place. &quot;A fire-red box with a glass front faces the sidewalk, with &apos;In case of emergency, BREAK GLASS&apos; lettered on it.&quot; The emergency box is closed and transparent. Understand &quot;glass&quot; as the box. Instead of attacking the closed emergency box: say &quot;You hit the emergency box, which shatters open.&quot;; now the emergency box is open. Instead of attacking the open emergency box: say &quot;The glass has already been thoroughly broken.&quot;\n\nThe syringe is in the emergency box. The description of the syringe is &quot;It contains the cure for Gelato&apos;s Syndrome. You can inject anyone you like with it.&quot;\n\nThe bronze gates are northeast of Marciony Street. The bronze gates are a door. The bronze gates are lockable and unlocked.  The description of the bronze gates is &quot;Erected during the milk-taint revolution of 1937, they were designed to keep Main Street safe from the depredations of dairy-starved rioters.&quot;\n\nThe Public Library is east of Main Street. &quot;Built in the 1920s during the height of the dairy boom, the public library has lush pink velvet seats, marble walls the color of fresh cream, and a motif of cherries carved around every doorframe. An incongruous sign hangs from the ceiling.&quot; The incongruous sign is scenery in the Public Library. The description of the incongruous sign is &quot;Eating and drinking in the library is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.&quot;\n\nTown Hall is southeast of Main Street. &quot;Town Hall was built during the slow days of the ice-cream bust, and therefore it is as joyless and utilitarian as the Public Library is ridiculous. Unwilling to be reminded of their pain, the inhabitants steered clear of any decoration that might remotely be construed to resemble a scoop of anything: so there are no curves, only disciplined right angles.&quot; The key to the city is in Town Hall. It unlocks the iron gate. It unlocks the bronze gates.  The description of the key to the city is &quot;A skeleton key.&quot;\n\nA room can be indoors or outdoors. The Post Office, the Alfred Cralle Pool Hall, the Store, Cold Comfort, Town Hall, and the Library are indoors.\n\nUse full-length room descriptions.\n\nAfter looking in an outdoors room:\n\tlet started printing be false;\n\tnow every proximate door is not mentioned;\n\tif an indoors room is adjacent:\n\t\tlet started printing be true;\n\t\tsay &quot;From here you can head into [the list of adjacent indoors rooms][if a proximate door is not mentioned], or go through [the list of proximate doors which are not mentioned][end if].

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:</p>

</div></details><p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they&#39;ve all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.</p>
<p>This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won&#39;t take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn&#39;t already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:</p>
