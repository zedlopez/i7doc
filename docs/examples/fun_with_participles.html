<p>Mostly the Standard Rules use verbs adapted to finite forms (&quot;he jumped&quot;, &quot;we take the hammer&quot;, and so on). But Inform can also produce participles to describe actions that are ongoing: &quot;he is carrying the fedora&quot; or &quot;taking the hammer&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>In this example, we give non-player characters actions to perform and then have Inform dynamically describe what they&#39;re doing when the player chooses to look.</p>
<p>We start by establishing the idea that a verb can describe a particular action:</p>
