<p>Suppose we have a situation where the player is allowed to talk about the heat of an object only if he&#39;s properly equipped to detect it.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Heat is a kind of value. The heats are hot, warm, room temperature, and cold. A thing has a heat.</div>

The description is &quot;A pair of head-mounted IR goggles which look very foolish when worn.&quot; The goggles are wearable.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A glass dish is a kind of container. A glass dish is transparent. Three room temperature glass dishes are on the counter. Two hot glass dishes are on the counter. Two cold glass dishes are on the counter. The counter is scenery in the Test Kitchen.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of doing something other than examining to a hot glass dish:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Ow! Crikey! You swear, and Claudia makes a sympathetic hiss. &#39;You&#39;re going to have a mark from that for sure,&#39; she comments.&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;decrease the score by 2.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of doing something when a hot glass dish is the second noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You brush [the second noun], and wince, but manage to conceal that from Claudia.&quot;;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before printing the plural name of a glass dish when the player wears the goggles: say &quot;[heat] &quot;</div>
</div><p>So far, so good. Now, what if the player tries to GET HOT DISH when the goggles are off? &quot;You can&#39;t see any such thing.&quot; doesn&#39;t seem like quite the right response: he can see such a thing. He just doesn&#39;t know which it is.</p>
<p>We could go on to write a mistake rule that would scold the player for trying &quot;get [heat] [text]&quot; when not wearing the goggles. The problem is that this would not cover any other phrasing of the command, nor would it account for all the many other things the player might try to do with an object specified by heat.</p>
<p>What we really want is to catch all instances of the player using the property name when not allowed to do so; and for this purpose we can borrow a trick from the <a href="WI_18.html">chapter on Activities</a>:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the player wears the goggles, make no decision;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Without the IR goggles on, you cannot tell hot things from cold at sight.&quot;;</div>
