<p>Inform already understands YES, NO, and SORRY as commands in their own right, which can make things a little sticky when we want a character to ask a question of the player. The most important thing is not to cover some of the possible phrasings while ignoring others.</p>

</div><p>The complexity arises from the fact that we want to handle both YES and SYBIL, YES. If we only had the latter, &#39;yes&#39; would be treated as a text given to the Sybil, just as in the commands SAY YES TO SYBIL or ANSWER YES. But because we have defined it as a command (so that the player can use it independently), SYBIL, YES is understood as an order to the Sybil to do the YES action.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can redirect everything, as here, so that the results wind up the same.</p>
<p>And if we want yet another variation not covered by the Inform standard:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;tell [someone] [text]&quot; as answering it that. Understand &quot;tell [someone] that [text]&quot; as answering it that.</div>
</div><p>But that is a matter for a later chapter.</p>
