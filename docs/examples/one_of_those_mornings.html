<div class="codeline">Finding is an action applying to one visible thing.</div>

<div class="codeline">Carry out finding:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the player is carrying the noun:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You left [the noun] [if the noun is on a supporter]on[otherwise]in[end if] [the holder of the noun].&quot;</div>
</div><p>The holder of the noun can be a room, a supporter, or a container: the phrase is not picky. We would want to be a little more careful if it were ever possible for an item to have been &quot;removed from play&quot; in our game, since then the holder could be nothing, and that would have odd results. In this particular example, though, that will not arise.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it, as far as the find command goes. The rest is local color.</p>
