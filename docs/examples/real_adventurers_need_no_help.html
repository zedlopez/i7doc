<p>Suppose we have an action called &quot;asking for help&quot; that gives the player some hints on request. We&#39;ve also made it possible to turn this feature off, if the player would like to discourage himself from using the hints too much. Now we need a value that varies to keep track of whether hints are currently permitted or currently not permitted. So we might write:</p>
