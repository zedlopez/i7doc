<p>Because scene rules are checked every turn, they can be useful for designing puzzles which have multiple solutions. Instead of deciding the puzzle is &quot;solved&quot; when the player does a certain action, we set up a scene that checks to see whether the player has achieved a certain outcome -- however he accomplished it.</p>
