<p>Suppose we want to add a sense of some conversational flow, so that the player is forced to acknowledge the presence of people before beginning detailed conversations with them. We collect all speech actions into a single category:</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Asking someone about something is speech. Telling someone about something is speech. Answering someone that something is speech. Asking someone for something is speech.</div>
</div><p>And then write a general rule.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before speech in the presence of an ungreeted person: try waving hands.</div>
</div><p>One complication is that &quot;asking someone to try doing something&quot;, which describes commands such as FRED, GO SOUTH, cannot be made into a kind of action. This requires its own rule:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Before asking someone to try doing something in the presence of an ungreeted person: try waving hands.</div>
</div><p>Now we define what greetings are going to look like:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Check waving hands:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;unless the player can see someone who is not the player, say &quot;You are alone.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out waving hands:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You nod hello to [the list of ungreeted people who can be seen by the player].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now every ungreeted person who can be seen by the player is greeted.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The report waving hands rule is not listed in the report waving hands rulebook.</div>
</div><p>Because of the way we&#39;ve defined the command, this will now also work if the player waves.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A person can be greeted or ungreeted. A person is usually ungreeted. The player is greeted.</div>
</div><p>And now the scenario:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The International Convention of Mimes is a room. Lester, Harold, Geoff, Kwame, and Peter are men in the Convention. Elouise is a woman in the Convention. The Invisible Box is an enterable container in the Convention. &quot;You can detect, from the way people keep leaning on it, an invisible box in the middle of the room.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Lester carries a bowler hat.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of speech in the presence of someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;describe poor reception.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">At 9:01 AM:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move Phineas to the location; say &quot;A mime called Phineas appears from the non-existent bathroom.&quot;</div>

<div class="codeline">Phineas is a man.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A persuasion rule:</div>

<div class="codeline">To describe poor reception:</div>
