<p>If somebody tries to walk through a closed door, the &quot;can&#39;t go through closed doors rule&quot; usually stops them. This is a rule belonging to the &quot;check going&quot; rulebook. These names are fairly explanatory when written out, but hard to remember: fortunately we don&#39;t need to remember them, as the Index panel contains a full inventory of the check, carry out and report rules for every action, showing all of their names and the order in which they are checked. (We can also find out which rules are stopping an action by typing the testing command ACTIONS.)</p>
<p>Here we make the rule do nothing provided a condition holds:</p>
