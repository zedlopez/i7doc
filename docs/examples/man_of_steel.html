<p>It will sometimes be handy to write actions that are only available to the non-player characters and not to the player. To do this, we just define an action which has no &quot;understand&quot;: the player will never be able to specify this command himself, but other characters can try it.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for creating abstract or general actions for when we want a character to eat something, wear something, or go somewhere, but aren&#39;t too particular as to what the object is; as here, where we just want Clark to move away from the kryptonite, regardless of direction:</p>
