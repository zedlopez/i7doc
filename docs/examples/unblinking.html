<p>Suppose we&#39;re simulating a situation where the player needs to travel through lit areas only, but we want to give him some hints about which way might be safe. Here we&#39;ll find our best route through light-filled rooms.</p>
<p>The slightly tricky part is that it&#39;s not necessarily easy to tell whether a room has a lamp in it. We may say &quot;if the Crypt is lighted&quot;, but that only tells us whether it has been declared to be inherently lighted or dark, not whether it happens to contain a light source that the player would be able to see if he went in.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get around this is to create an object -- the light-meter; place it in the target location; and check whether it &quot;can see&quot; a lit object. This preserves all the usual rules about open and closed containers, transparency, etc.</p>

</div></details><p>An important word of caution: this method would give false negatives if there were a backdrop lightsource, such as the moon, providing light to the Upward Path. This is because backdrops are actually moved around the map by Inform during play, following the player around. So if the moon backdrop is in the Crash Site with the player, it will not be in the Upward Path as well -- even if it&#39;s scheduled to move there as soon as the player does.</p>
