<p>Suppose we want to allow the player to go to sleep some of the time:</p>

<div class="codeline">A person is either awake or asleep. A person is usually awake.</div>
</div><p>The important thing to note here is that it does not work to say &quot;the player is either asleep or awake&quot;. This is because the player is not necessarily one specific person or thing during the game: the identity of the player can be changed, as we will see later.</p>
<p>So if we want to make rules about the properties of the player, we should attach these rules to the &quot;person&quot; kind.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Linear Algebra Class is a room. &quot;The blackboard is covered with square arrangements of numbers. These are supposed to convey something to you, but mostly you&#39;re finding them soporific.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Now a few rules about changing from one state to the other:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of sleeping: now the player is asleep; say &quot;You drop off.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of doing something other than waking up, waiting or sleeping when the player is asleep:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Ssh! You&#39;re sleeping!&quot;</div>

<div class="codeline">Instead of sleeping when the player is asleep:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Zzzz.&quot;</div>

<div class="codeline">Instead of waking up when the player is asleep:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;now the player is awake;</div>
