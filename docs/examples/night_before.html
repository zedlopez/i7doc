<p>Suppose that we&#39;re going to give every person in the game a nose, but we want references to a nose always to mean the nose of someone *else*, if the player is with one other person. Moreover, on some occasions we&#39;re going to be in sight of Rudolph, so actions directed at an unspecified nose should always prefer his.</p>
<p>This relies on a somewhat advanced technique from the Understanding chapter, but since it may become useful with assemblies and body parts, it is worth mentioning here.</p>

</div><p>Next, we&#39;ll teach Inform some vocabulary to distinguish between the player and everyone else:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is selfish if it is part of the player and the player can see an other person.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining a selfish nose:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You cross your eyes, but can&#39;t get a good look.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Here is the part that actually determines the preferences. &quot;Does the player mean&hellip;&quot; can result in five outcomes: &quot;it is very unlikely&quot;, &quot;it is unlikely&quot;, &quot;it is possible&quot; (the neutral default), &quot;it is likely&quot;, and &quot;it is very likely&quot;. This is discussed in greater detail in the Understanding chapter. Here, we want to discourage references to the player&#39;s own nose and encourage references to the nose of Rudolph, so:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Does the player mean doing something when the noun is a selfish nose or the second noun is a selfish nose: it is very unlikely.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Does the player mean doing something to Rudolph&#39;s nose: it is very likely.</div>
</div><p>And this part is just for decoration:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for writing a paragraph about Rudolph:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The reindeer are already harnessed and waiting impatiently. The brilliance of [Rudolph]&#39;s nose casts an eerie red glow over [the list of unmentioned animals in the location].&quot;</div>
