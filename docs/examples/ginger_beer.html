<p>Suppose we want to have a pair of linked lenses so that the player can look into one of them and see things which occur in room containing the other lense.</p>
<p>We begin simply with a bit of environment for the player to wander around:</p>

</div><p>Here is the critical bit, which needs to be somewhat flexible, since the large end of the telescope could in theory be left anywhere in the game (and should still work).</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After deciding the scope of the player while the small end is carried by the player:</div>

<div class="codeline">Instead of searching the large end,</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You see only your own reflection.&quot;</div>
</div><p>We also want to make sure that the player who looks through the small lense does not see the large lense listed among the contents of the other location:</p>
