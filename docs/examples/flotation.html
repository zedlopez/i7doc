<p>Here we want a rulebook to determine whether objects float or sink, so we create an object-based rulebook for the purpose. The more specific rules here, pertaining to corks and to inflated things, will be consulted first; then, as a default, the general flotation rule.</p>
<p>We also want a switch that can turn flotation off at will. The rule about the big switch will be observed before the others because the when&hellip; clause makes it more specific than the other rules in the flotation rulebook.</p>
<p>If we wanted, we could also put these rules into a rulebook in an explicit order, overriding Inform&#39;s automatic sorting by specificity.</p>

</div><p>As we recall from the <a href="WI_18.html">chapter on activities</a>, &quot;writing a paragraph about&hellip;&quot; is an activity; activities are themselves structured as sets of object-based rulebooks. The activity &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; uses three object-based rulebooks (before writing&hellip;, for writing&hellip;, after writing&hellip;). We could have made a flotation activity as well, but in general it is overkill to make an activity to make success/failure decisions. For that purpose an object-based rulebook is sufficient.</p>
