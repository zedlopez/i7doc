<p class="example-desc">A book with pages that can be read by number (as in &quot;read page 3 in...&quot;) and which accepts relative page references as well (such as &quot;read the last page of...&quot;, &quot;read the next page&quot;, and so on).</p>

<p>Suppose we have a book that the player must consult page-by-page, and we want to be able to accept all of the following input:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&gt; READ BOOK (to choose a random page and read it)</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ PAGE 1 IN BOOK</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ PAGE 2</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOK</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ THE NEXT PAGE</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ PREVIOUS PAGE IN BOOK</div>
<div class="codeline">&gt; READ THE FIRST PAGE</div>
</div><p>One approach would be to write many different understand rules and actions: one action for reading randomly, one for reading a specific page, one for reading the first page, one for reading the previous page, one for reading the next page, and one for reading the last page. But this gets tedious to construct and maintain.</p>
<p>More usefully, we could consider that all of the last four options are essentially the same action at heart: the player is asking to read a page in the book using a name rather than a number, and we will have to perform a minor calculation to discover what the number should be. Here&#39;s an implementation using named values to resolve this problem:</p>
