<p>Suppose we have a whole catalog-full of equipment that the player might want to purchase and use. We&#39;ll start by defining our purchasing rules:</p>

</div><p>We allow things to have prices, and the player&#39;s price to indicate how much money the player has:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline i7header">Section 1 - Mail-ordering defined</div><div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Price is a kind of value. $100.99 specifies a price.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player has a price. The price of the player is $60.00.</div>
</div><p>Because we&#39;re allowing the player to order things that he can&#39;t currently see, we need to borrow a special kind of grammar from the Understanding chapter. All our orderable items in this example are toys, so &quot;any toy&quot; means any object of the toy kind, whether or not it is in view at the moment:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;buy [any toy]&quot; as ordering. Understand the command &quot;order&quot; as something new. Understand the command &quot;order&quot; as &quot;buy&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Ordering is an action applying to one visible thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check ordering:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;if the cost of the noun is greater than the price of the player, say &quot;You only have [price of the player], while [the noun] would cost [cost of the noun].&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out ordering:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;move the noun to the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;decrease the price of the player by the cost of the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report ordering:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You order [a noun], which is delivered instantly.&quot;</div>
</div><p>We should also handle the situation where the player orders another of something he has already bought and which is right in front of him:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of buying something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You already have [a noun].&quot;</div>
</div><p>So much for the general rules for this scenario. Now we move on to particulars: the actual items the player is allowed to order. Each item will have a description, a price, and a difficulty representing how skilled the player must be in order to make use of that item.</p>
<p>Since we are going to use price and difficulty in the table that defines our juggling equipment, we need to mention these kinds of value before the line that says how toys are defined.</p>
