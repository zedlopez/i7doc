<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose our game features a detailed simulated combat between the player character and his opponent. He might have several weapons available, and several types of attack available; and at any given time he might be perched up in the rigging of his ship, standing on the open deck, or boxed in between some barrels. His options will vary depending on his position, and obviously it would detract from the pacing to make the player keep LOOKing in the middle of combat in order to remind himself where he is. Instead, we&#39;ll roll this information into the command prompt:</p>
