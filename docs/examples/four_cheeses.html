Bullet-proof windows offer a panoramic view of serene cliffs, palm trees, and a moonlit ocean. Occasionally someone is foolish enough to try a cliff ascent or even an attack by helicopter, but lately things have been pretty quiet.\n\nThe mansion is up the hill behind you, security lights ablaze.&quot;\n\nThe grey telephone is a telephone in the Guard House. Understand &quot;6885&quot; as the grey telephone. &quot;Before you is a grey telephone. In black marker someone has written on it: MAIN OFFICE 2802.&quot;\n\nBefore going a direction in the Guard House, say &quot;And leave your post? The boss would have you flayed. No kidding.&quot; instead.\n\n\nThe Main Office is a room. The boss is a known woman in the Main Office. A telephone called the red telephone is in the Main Office. Understand &quot;2802&quot; as the red telephone.\n\nThe Guild is a room. The ninja is an unknown man in the Guild. A telephone called the black telephone is in the Guild. Understand &quot;4431&quot; as the black telephone.\n\nPotter&apos;s Pizza is a room. The pizza delivery boy is a known man in Pizza. A telephone called the saucy telephone is in Pizza. Understand &quot;8885&quot; as the saucy telephone.\n\nThe chatter of the boss is the Table of Boss Conversation. The chatter of the delivery boy is the Table of Pizza Conversation. The chatter of the ninja is the Table of Ninja Conversation.\n\nAfter calling the red telephone on something for the first time:\n\tsay &quot;&apos;Yes?&apos; asks the boss. Her voice is especially husky this evening. Maybe that night of passion isn&apos;t so far off after all.&quot;\n\nTable of Boss Conversation\ntopic\treply\n&quot;love/passion/tonight/night&quot; or &quot;night of passion&quot;\t&quot;&apos;...Sorry, what?&apos; she asks. &apos;I wasn&apos;t listening.&apos; Oh.

Yes, this is definitely time for a call to your old friend, the pizza boy.&quot;\n&quot;imminent ninja attack&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Don&apos;t worry about it,&apos; says the boss crisply. &apos;I have everything under control.&apos;&quot;\n\nTable of Pizza Conversation\ntopic\treply\n&quot;pizza&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Pepperoni special tonight!&apos; he says proudly.&quot;\n&quot;pepperoni&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Pepperoni is included free on ALL our pizzas,&apos; he says proudly.&quot;\n&quot;no pepperoni&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Well, I don&apos;t see why you&apos;d want that,&apos; replies the boy sniffily. &apos;It&apos;s free!&apos;&quot;\n&quot;jalapeno&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Sorry, we&apos;re out of jalapenos this evening.

Nobody ever counts. The stringy one, the one that comes in dollops and the orangey one. You know.&apos;&quot;\n&quot;pineapple&quot;\t&quot;&apos;We could put pineapple on there, sure,&apos; says the delivery boy, in a tone that lets you know his opinion of people who order fruit-based pizzas.&quot;\n&quot;pineapple and garlic&quot;\t&quot;&apos;What kind of crazy combination is that?&apos; demands the delivery boy, finally losing all self-control.&quot;\n&quot;delivery&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Well, I don&apos;t know,&apos; says the boy in a worried voice. &apos;Last time I came there were attack dogs. And ninjas.&apos;&quot;\n&quot;massive gratuity&quot;\t&quot;&apos;There&apos;s no use in a big tip you don&apos;t live to spend,&apos; says the delivery boy quite firmly.&quot;\n\nTable of Ninja Conversation\ntopic\treply\n&quot;imminent attack&quot;\t&quot;&apos;Yes, still on for tonight,&apos; confirms the voice at the other end of the line.&quot;\n&quot;pizza delivery boy&quot;\t&quot;The voice, in tones of velvet, indicates that it cannot guarantee the safety of any delivery persons whomsoever.&quot;\n\nTest me with &quot;call 2802 / examine boss / ask boss about night of passion / ask boss about pizza / listen to telephone / call delivery boy on telephone / ask boy about cheese / tell boy about no pepperoni / ask boy about delivery / tell boy about massive gratuity / attack boy&quot;.`)">⧉</button><div class="codeline storytitle">&quot;Four Cheeses&quot;</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if a person (called the listener) can see the noun, now the player reaches the listener.</div>
</div><p>Because we&#39;ve said that connection is a reciprocal, one-to-one relationship, Inform will do the rest of the bookkeeping: if (for instance) we telephone someone else, the first connection will be broken automatically.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Report calling it on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;&#39;Hello?&#39; says [the other party of the player].&quot;</div>
</div><p>To avoid annoyance, we should also let the player use CALL #### as well as CALL #### ON TELEPHONE. A rule from the <a href="WI_18.html">chapter on Activities</a> comes in handy here:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Rule for supplying a missing second noun while calling something on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;assign a phone.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>

</div><p>Things might be a little more complicated if we had cell phones that could be moved around, but for right now the player can only touch a maximum of one phone at a time.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end current conversation.</div>
</div><p>And finally we want to make sure that calling random other numbers produces a sensible result:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;call [text]&quot; as misdialling. Misdialling is an action applying to one topic. Carry out misdialling: say &quot;The phone rings and rings but no one answers.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;call 911&quot; or &quot;call 999&quot; or &quot;call police&quot; or &quot;call fire department&quot; as a mistake (&quot;After strict warnings, you&#39;ve given up making prank calls to emergency services.&quot;).</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before misdialling when the player reaches someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;(first ending your conversation with [the other party of the player])[command clarification break]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end current conversation.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">To end current conversation:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let the current phone be a random telephone which can be touched by the player;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;silently try hanging up the current phone.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After deciding the scope of the player while the player reaches someone:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;place the other party of the player in scope, but not its contents.</div>
</div><p>A note about this scope addition: the player can refer to the other party whenever he has the other person on the phone. He can&#39;t, however, see or refer to anything that person might be holding or wearing, thanks to the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the player can&#39;t actually do anything to that person that requires touching. That&#39;s because of the reaching inside rules, which govern whether the player can reach through intervening barriers such as rooms. (See the <a href="WI_12.html">Advanced Actions chapter</a> for more about changing reachability.) There are two things we might want to be careful about, though.</p>
<p>First, we should specifically disallow the player from looking at the person on the other end of the line. Since sight doesn&#39;t require touching, the reaching inside rules will not be consulted about a command such as EXAMINE BOSS or LOOK UNDER BOSS. We can, however, intervene in such cases using the visibility rules, which are consulted for any actions that &quot;require light&quot; (including EXAMINE and LOOK UNDER). Here again we borrow some options from the <a href="WI_12.html">Advanced Actions chapter</a>:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">To decide whether acting through the line:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is something and the location of the noun is not the location of the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;yes;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is something and the location of the second noun is not the location of the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;yes;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;no.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Visibility rule when acting through the line:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;there is insufficient light.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Rule for printing a refusal to act in the dark when acting through the line:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You&#39;re not on a video phone, so you can only hear.&quot; instead.</div>
</div><p>Second, though the existing reaching inside rules are adequate to stop us from touching the person on the other end of the line, the response that&#39;s currently printed is a bit generic: it just says &quot;You can&#39;t reach into [the room containing the person].&quot; Let&#39;s add our own custom reply, instead:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A rule for reaching inside a room (called destination):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the other party of the player is enclosed by the destination:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Though you&#39;re on the line with [the other party of the player], you can&#39;t physically reach to [the destination].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;deny access.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline i7header">Section 2 - Conversation over the Phone, In General</div></div><p>This portion supplies a simple method of conversation; but we could substitute some completely different conversation system if appropriate. The effect of the telephones is that we are allowed to talk to characters in distant locations under certain circumstances, after which the usual conversation rules apply.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Instead of listening to a telephone when the player reaches someone:</div>
