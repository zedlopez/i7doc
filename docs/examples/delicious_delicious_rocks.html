<p>In some cases, we may want to add new stages to action processing. One possibility is a stage where we check the sanity of what the player is trying to do before executing any of the other commands; so that we avoid, for instance</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">&gt;EAT ROCK</div>
<div class="codeline">(first taking the rock)</div>
<div class="codeline">That&#39;s plainly inedible.</div>
</div><p>Here is how we might insert such a stage in our action processing, using rulebook manipulation.</p>

</div><p>&hellip;and in a small game with few rules, there&#39;s not much reason to add an extra stage. The ability to modify the stages of action processing becomes useful when we have a fairly large game with sophisticated modeling and want to be sure that some kinds of message (such as the sanity-check) are always handled before other things that we might be doing at the before stage (such as generating implicit actions like opening doors before going through them).</p>
