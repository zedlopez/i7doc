<div class="example-body"><p>Suppose we wanted to add intermediate compass directions such as north-northwest to our game. Because of the limitations of the index map, we won&#39;t be able to view these connections on the world map, but we can certainly create them, and use them in route-finding, just like other directions.</p>

</div><p>A complication arises because we reach the 9-character limit: Inform truncates the names of objects to nine characters before trying to understand them. To make matters worse, the hyphen (and other punctuation marks) count as two letters. So both north-northwest and north-northeast will get truncated to &quot;north-no&quot;, and be indistinguishable when the player types them.</p>
<p>When we are compiling for Glulx, the limit is easily changed with a single line, setting the constant called DICT_WORD_SIZE. For instance, if we wanted to raise the limit to 15, we would simply write &quot;Use DICT_WORD_SIZE of 15.&quot;</p>
<p>If we&#39;re compiling to the Z-machine, however, we&#39;ll have to resort to some manipulation of the player&#39;s command. The general solution is that when the player&#39;s name for an object is going to have to be longer than we can correctly read, we can substitute an unambiguous abbreviation for the thing the player typed. In this case, it will be simplest and most efficient always to condense the player&#39;s direction names to single letters, thus:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After reading a command:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be &quot;[the player&#39;s command]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;replace the text &quot;north&quot; in N with &quot;n&quot;;</div>

</div></details><p>In practice, this is going to be overkill for almost all games: most players already find eight compass directions plus up and down to be enough (or more than enough) to keep track of. But the option exists, in case there is a compelling reason to use it.</p>
<p>(Note also that we are allowed to use multi-word direction names, so we could  have called the directions &quot;north by northwest&quot;, &quot;north by northeast&quot;, and so on. This example deliberately takes the hard way in order to show how to resolve the nine-character problem.)</p>
