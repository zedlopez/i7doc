<p class="example-desc">An adaptive hint system that tracks what the player needs to have seen or to possess in order to solve a given puzzle, and doles out suggestions accordingly. Handles changes in the game state with remarkable flexibility, and allows the player to decide how explicit a nudge he wants at any given moment.</p>

<p>Hint systems in IF come in a variety of flavors: some are a static, prewritten set of guidelines (which might exist in a menu or outside the game entirely); others are built in as part of the program, and attempt to adapt to the situation the player currently faces. Adaptive hints have the advantage that they are less likely to reveal information for which the player is not ready, and the disadvantage that they are more work for the author.</p>
<p>The exercise here is to write an adaptive hint system that will both respond in agile ways to the state of the world model and require a minimum of authorial fussing. We also want the player to be able to ask for a hint about any object he encounters in the game world: this will let him be specific and avoid accidentally receiving hints about the wrong puzzles.</p>
<p>Our baseline assumption is that a player may find a puzzle unsolvable for one of two reasons: he either hasn&#39;t seen the relevant clue, or he hasn&#39;t got the relevant equipment. If these are true, then he should be given hints about how to find this information, and then once he has it, more specific hints about the puzzle itself &ndash; ending, as a last resort, with the exact command(s) he will need to use in order to bring about the solution.</p>
<p>In practice, there are other possibilities, but this will do for an example.</p>
<p>We begin by defining our relations:</p>

<div class="codeline">Hinting about is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand &quot;hint about [any thing]&quot; as hinting about.</div>
</div><p>This allows us to create the most absolutely generic sort of hint &ndash; boring, perhaps, but in practice the player often just needs a nudge about what part of the game world he should be examining for a solution:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out hinting about:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if something explains the noun, say &quot;You might want to review [the list of things which explain the noun]. &quot;;</div>

</div><p>These things cover hinting about objects that are themselves puzzles. But what if the player asks for hints about a tool or piece of information because he doesn&#39;t know how to apply it yet? We might want to give some guidance there, as well.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out hinting about something which explains something (called target):</div>

</div><p>And this business of &quot;seen&quot; things requires, of course, that we keep track:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A thing can be seen or unseen. A thing is usually unseen. The player is seen. After printing the name of something (called target): now the target is seen.</div>
</div><p>That &quot;After printing&hellip;&quot; rule means that as soon as the game automatically prints the name of an object, it tags that object as having been &quot;seen&quot; by the player. This requires just a little care on our part, that we never mention an object without using the game&#39;s printing rules. Still, it is much easier than most other possible forms of bookkeeping.</p>
<p>We also need to deal with the question of whether the player has examined an object, for those objects whose descriptions carry vital information:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.</div>
</div><p>In practice, there might be other ways of getting vital facts, and in a more sophisticated puzzle game we might need a more sophisticated model to track this. But examined or unexamined will do for now.</p>

</div><p>That covers most of the generic hints, but let&#39;s also add some slightly more precise hints about a few kinds of objects that are especially important in the model world.

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The lids are stone, too heavy for you to raise without some implement.&quot;</div>
</div><p>Now we can add specific hints to replace the generic ones:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out hinting about the tomb:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The lids are heavy, but you can open them when you carry the pry bar.&quot;</div>
</div><p>The rest of the hint system ensures that the player will not see this final suggestion until he has the pry bar, since the tomb &quot;requires&quot; the pry bar. Having the hint there doesn&#39;t excuse us from providing some alternate wording in case the player solves this not-very-difficult conundrum on his own, though:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;pry [something] with [something preferably held]&quot; as unlocking it with. Understand the commands &quot;lever&quot; or &quot;prise&quot; as &quot;pry&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of unlocking something with the pry bar, try opening the noun.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The wight is a man in the Crypt. &quot;[The wight] lurks near the south exit.&quot; The description of wight is &quot;Old English [italic type]wiht[roman type]: a thing, a creature. It is little more than the memory of a life ill-lived, but it lingers here.&quot; Understand &quot;wiht&quot; or &quot;creature&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot; as the wight.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of going south in the presence of wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The wight breathes chill into your face.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Your head swims, and you are aware that you no longer have the willpower to go in that direction.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Fresh Air is south from the Crypt.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After going to Fresh Air:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the score;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Congratulations, you have escaped!&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;end the story finally.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The inscription is fixed in place in the Crypt. &quot;Someone has painstakingly carved [an inscription] into the wall above the door.&quot; The description is &quot;Squinting, you decipher the Latin text: [italic type]Silver causes harm to those that live though dead[roman type].&quot; The inscription explains wight.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Treasure Chamber is north of the Crypt. &quot;The walls are thick, the high windows promisingly barred with iron. But for all this there is no hint of any valuable stores remaining.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The pry bar is in the Treasure Chamber. &quot;One of the window bars, rusted from its place, lies in a puddle of water.&quot; Understand &quot;window&quot; or &quot;bars&quot; as the pry bar. The description of the pry bar is &quot;A few feet long, and not entirely rusted into uselessness yet.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of giving the dagger to wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The wight recoils, appalled.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out hinting about wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You will have to find some way to get wight to come in physical contact with the silver dagger, which he will certainly not do willingly. [More]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if player consents, say &quot;You could, for instance, throw it at him.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;otherwise stop the action.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;touch [something] with [something]&quot; as putting it on (with nouns reversed). Understand &quot;hit [someone] with [something]&quot; as putting it on (with nouns reversed).</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of attacking the wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You can&#39;t force yourself to approach close enough for hand to hand combat: if, indeed, the wight has hands.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of putting the dagger on wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The wight fades out of your way without ever coming into contact with the dagger. Perhaps a more projectile method would work better.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of putting something on wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The wight dodges you.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of throwing the dagger at wight:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the wight is nowhere;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the dagger to the location;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the score;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;The dagger passes through its airy form with a rending like the rip of silk. The fragments dissipate at once.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The maximum score is 2.</div>
