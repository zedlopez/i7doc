<p>It stands to reason that the captain wouldn&#39;t let just anyone meddle with his fishing equipment; maybe he keeps that case locked. We could replace the case description with this one, instead:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><button class="copycode" title="Copy to clipboard" onclick="copyCode(`The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods. The case is closed, transparent, openable, lockable, and locked. The case is scenery. The small silver key unlocks the case.`)">⧉</button><div class="codeline">The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods. The case is closed, transparent, openable, lockable, and locked. The case is scenery. The small silver key unlocks the case.</div>
</div><p>Now there&#39;s a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven&#39;t said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all -- though we usually use the term &quot;out of play&quot; -- but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)</p>
