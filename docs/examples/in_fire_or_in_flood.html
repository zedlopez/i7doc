<div class="codeline">Before printing the name of something flaming:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;flaming &quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before burning something when the player is not carrying something flaming:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if a flaming portable thing (called the lighter) is touchable:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;(with [the lighter], which you first take)[command clarification break]&quot;;</div>

<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of burning something when the player is not carrying something flaming:</div>

<div class="codeline">Instead of burning something flame-retardant:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The noun] is not the sort of thing that catches fire.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of burning something flammable when the player is carrying something flaming (called the flame source):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You light [the noun] with [the flame source].&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the heat of the noun is flaming.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of burning something when the player is in the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;That seems dangerous given that you yourself are in [the noun].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of burning something when the player is on the noun:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;That seems dangerous given that you yourself are on [the noun].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Instead of examining something:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Hm, the [printed name] appears to be [heat].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Before taking a flaming thing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the noun minus the turns of burning of the noun;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if turns remaining is less than two, say &quot;There&#39;s no portion of [the noun] sufficiently cool for you to pick up.&quot; instead.</div>
</div><p>But that&#39;s only a small part of the battle. The thing about fire is that it keeps on doing fiery things even when the player is otherwise occupied: destroying items that are on fire, and spreading to other things nearby. So we need a set of rules for the fire&#39;s behavior.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Every turn when something is flaming:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;follow the fire rules.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The fire rules is a rulebook.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A fire rule (this is the can&#39;t hold flaming objects rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through flaming things:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the item is held by the player:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let turns remaining be the endurance of the item minus the turns of burning of the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if turns remaining is less than two:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;[The item] becomes too hot to hold! &quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try dropping the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the item is held by the player, say &quot;This is certainly painful.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A fire rule (this is the flames spread rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through flaming things:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the turns of burning of the item is one:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;spread the flames from the item.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A fire rule (this is the fire destroys things rule):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now started printing is false;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;repeat with item running through flaming things:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;increment the turns of burning of the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the turns of burning of the item is greater than the endurance of the item, destroy the item;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if started printing is true, say &quot;[paragraph break]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now started printing is false.</div>
</div><p>Because we&#39;ve labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual. For instance, if there were a pair of fireproof gloves in the game, we might want to turn off the &quot;can&#39;t hold flaming objects rule&quot; whenever the player is wearing them.</p>
<p>This sort of flexibility is especially useful in the context of extensions. Someone writing an extension about burning would have no way of anticipating the need for a Fireproof Gauntlet of Thog, but the author would nonetheless be able to implement one easily.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Definition: a thing is vulnerable if it is flammable and it is whole.</div>
</div><p>The contact between things is a critical factor when it comes to fire, so we might add a couple of conditional relations do determine what is touching what.</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on means the reliance relation.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is relying on Y or Y is relying on X. The verb to be joined to means the contact relation.</div>
</div><p>Having these at our disposal makes it much tidier to write what happens next:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">To spread the flames from (item - a thing):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now started printing is false;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the item is joined to a flammable whole thing (called the sacrifice):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the sacrifice is visible:</div>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now all the flammable whole things joined to the item are flaming.</div>
