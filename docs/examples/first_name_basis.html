<p>Sometimes we create objects that we want the player to be able to call by different names: a television that should also answer to &quot;tv&quot; and &quot;telly&quot;, for instance, or a refrigerator the player might also call &quot;fridge&quot;. In this case, we can use instructions like</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;tv&quot; and &quot;telly&quot; as the television.</div>
</div><p>to add extra names to the object we&#39;ve defined.</p>

<p>By default, Inform does not understand the names of an object&#39;s kind as referring to that object, unless the object has no other name of its own. We can change this, if we like, by defining names that should be applied to everything of a given kind:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Lewis and Harper are men in the Crew Lounge. Understand &quot;man&quot; or &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;chap&quot; or &quot;lad&quot; or &quot;male&quot; as a man.

</div></details><p>Inform&#39;s naming abilities go considerably further, in fact: we can also instruct it to understand words only under certain circumstances, or only when they appear with other words. Fuller details may be found in the chapter on Understanding.</p>
