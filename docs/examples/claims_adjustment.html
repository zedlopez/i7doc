<div class="example-body"><p>We start by creating a camera and a photograph object. As usual when we want to have a kind of object that can be dispensed in bulk, we start off with a bunch of identical instances of the object out of play (in this case, kept in an out-of-play container called &quot;film roll&quot;); we can then move them into play and give them characteristics when they&#39;re needed.</p>
<p>Each photograph can depict exactly one thing &ndash; we&#39;re assuming that the player is not a landscape photographer here &ndash; so we create a relation to indicate what is shown by each photograph. We&#39;ll then use that relation to determine how photographs are described, named, and parsed:</p>

<div class="codeline">A photograph is a kind of thing. 36 photographs are in the film roll.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Appearance relates one thing to various photographs. The verb to be shown by means the appearance relation.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The description of a photograph is usually &quot;It shows [a random thing which is shown by the item described].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;of [something related by reversed appearance]&quot; as a photograph.</div>
</div><p>This allows the player to refer to any photograph by its subject: useful if we have a large number of them.</p>
<p>Now we create an action to let the player use the camera and generate these photograph objects:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The player carries a cheap instant camera.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;photograph [something] with [camera]&quot; as photographing. Understand &quot;photograph [something] with [something preferably held]&quot; as photographing. Photographing is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing, requiring light.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The photographing action has an object called the selected film.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Setting action variables for photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be a random photograph in the film roll;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the selected film is N.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the second noun is not the camera, say &quot;You need a camera for that purpose.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is the camera, say &quot;Sadly impossible.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Check photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the selected film is nothing, say &quot;You&#39;re out of film.&quot; instead.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Carry out photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;now the noun is shown by the selected film;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;move the selected film to the player.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report photographing:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;Your camera instantly spits out [a selected film].&quot;</div>
</div><p>Now we use two activities from the Activities chapter to describe the photographs to the player more elegantly:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">After printing the name of a photograph (called target):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot; of [a random thing which is shown by the target]&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">After printing the plural name of a photograph (called target):</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let N be the holder of the target;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot; of [a list of things which are shown by photographs which are held by N]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the number of things which are shown by photographs which are held by N is greater than one, say &quot; (variously)&quot;.</div>
</div><p>And finally we provide a brief scenario to give the player something to take pictures of:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Treasure Room is a room. &quot;Despite the fancy name, this is no more than a closet -- albeit a closet with its own special circuit on the house alarm.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The Treasure Room contains a small Degas, a Ming vase, and a collection of South African krugerrands. The player is carrying insurance forms, a first-class stamp, and a security envelope.</div>
<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
