<div class="example-body"><p>The original Adventure allowed the player to type the names of rooms in order to move to them, and it is now not too difficult for us to do the same. Adventure restricted this option to adjacent rooms, but we might want to be a bit more flexible, so we will accept any room:</p>

<div class="codeline blankline">&thinsp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Going by name is an action applying to one thing.</div>
</div><p>We should reject movement to the player&#39;s current location, or to anywhere he hasn&#39;t been and can&#39;t see:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Check going by name:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is the location, say &quot;You&#39;re already in [the location].&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the noun is not adjacent and the noun is unvisited, say &quot;That noun did not make sense in this context.&quot; instead.</div>
</div><p>The assumption here is that the player does know the names of the rooms adjacent to his current location, even if he hasn&#39;t been there yet.</p>
<p>Now for the travel itself. The simplest way to ensure that the usual movement rules will still apply is to convert GO BY NAME into a GO action, and here the best route comes to our aid:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Carry out going by name:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if aim is not a direction, say &quot;You can&#39;t think how to get there from here.&quot; instead;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;(heading [aim])[command clarification break]&quot;;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;try going aim;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if the location is not the noun, say &quot;You&#39;ll have to stop here.&quot;</div>
</div><p>This will allow the player to travel toward rooms he has already visited even if they are several moves away.</p>
<p>Finally, so that the player can also use the names of doors as commands:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;[door]&quot; as entering.</div>
</div><p>And in keeping with the original, we might add to our scenario a rule or two about restrictions on movement, just to test that it&#39;s all working right:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The player carries a plover egg and a platinum pyramid. The description of the egg is &quot;Plover&#39;s eggs, by the way, are quite large.&quot; The printed name of the egg is &quot;emerald the size of a plover&#39;s egg&quot;. Understand &quot;emerald&quot; as the egg. The description of the pyramid is &quot;The platinum pyramid is 8 inches on a side!&quot;</div>
