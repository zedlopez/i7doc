<p>Seven-digit telephone numbers are too long for Inform to handle when compiling to the Z-Machine, but they will work under Glulx. To have this example succeed, make sure that you have selected the Glulx option in your settings menu.</p>

<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A telephone is a kind of thing. Understand &quot;phone&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; as a telephone.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">A phone number is a kind of value. 999-9999 specifies a phone number.</div>
</div><p>Now we borrow some techniques from the Understanding chapter to set up dialing actions:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;dial [phone number] on [telephone]&quot; as dialing it on. Understand &quot;dial [phone number] on [something]&quot; as dialing it on.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand the commands &quot;phone&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; or &quot;call&quot; as &quot;dial&quot;.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;call [text]&quot; or &quot;phone [text]&quot; or &quot;dial [text]&quot; or &quot;telephone [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;That&#39;s not a number you know.&quot;).</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Dialing it on is an action applying to one phone number and one thing.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Report dialing it on:</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;say &quot;You dial [the phone number understood].&quot;</div>
</div><p>This much is enough to let us dial telephone numbers and have Inform report that we&#39;ve done so; it doesn&#39;t actually provide a telephone system such that we could reach and converse with other characters (but see the other telephone examples in the recipe book for more on how one might do that).</p>
<p>We&#39;ll set up a little political espionage scenario from which our player can make calls:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The Senator&#39;s Junior Suite is a room. &quot;The Senator appears, unfortunately, to have very precise habits: little in the room has been moved from its usual place; the trash can is empty; the bed has been remade[if the blue paper is unexamined]. There may in fact be nothing to find here[end if].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The bed is an enterable scenery supporter in the Junior Suite.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The player is wearing a housekeeping uniform and a brunette wig. The player carries a telephone called a Nokia.</div>
</div><p>Borrowing again from the chapter on Understanding, we might arrange things so that the player knows and can call a few standard numbers with such syntax as CALL HOME:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">Understand &quot;home&quot; as 555-9200.</div>
</div><p>And what if we&#39;d like to have the player learn some phone numbers during the game?</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">A thing can be examined or unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Understand &quot;Stephen&quot; as 555-2513 when the blue paper is examined.</div>
</div><p>This will understand CALL STEPHEN once the paper is examined; before that, the player will just get the &quot;That&#39;s not a number you know&quot; response that Inform uses for all attempts to call unknown names.</p>
<p>We&#39;d better plant this paper for the player to find:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeline">The blue paper is in the drawer. The description of the blue paper is &quot;It reads: &#39;Call Stephen - 555-2513&#39;.&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">The drawer is part of the dresser. It is closed and openable. The dresser is in The Senator&#39;s Junior Suite. The lamp is on the dresser. The description of the dresser is &quot;The single drawer is [if the drawer is open]open[otherwise]shut[end if].&quot;</div>
<div class="codeline">&ensp;&ensp;</div>
<div class="codeline">Test me with &quot;dial 555-9999 / call home on the telephone / phone the president / call stephen / open drawer / read paper / call stephen / put phone in drawer / close drawer / call stephen&quot;.</div>
