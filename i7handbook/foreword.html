<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2></summary>

<p>Somebody once said that if you ask five poets to define poetry,
you’ll get seven definitions. I’m sure I’m misquoting wildly &ndash; the
original version may not have been about poetry at all &ndash; but the point
should be clear. There are undoubtedly more good ways to explain the
intricacies of the Inform 7 programming language than there are people
who have written tutorials on the subject.</p>

<p>This book makes no claim to being the ultimate guide to Inform 7. On
the contrary: A number of topics that experienced Inform authors (or new
authors who envision unusual types of gameplay) may want or need to know
about simply aren’t included in <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em>, or are
mentioned only in passing. The purpose of this book is to give
first-time authors the kind of information and insight that they’ll need
in order to start using Inform 7 to produce parser-based interactive
fiction in its most familiar form, without getting tangled up in a lot
of complexities. (If you don’t know what I mean by “parser-based,” keep
reading.) This version of the <em>Handbook</em> is current with respect
to version 6L38 of Inform 7, and may not be accurate with respect to
older or more recent versions.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to organize the material in ways that will help newcomers
find useful information quickly. I’ve attempted, as well, to write in a
way that makes few or no assumptions about what the reader already
knows. If you read the <em>Handbook</em> page by page from start to
finish, you’ll spot a few repetitions; I felt that some minor redundancy
would be better than forcing readers to hunt for information.</p>

<p>Inform 7 (“I7” for short) comes bundled with two long and detailed
tutorial/reference books, <a href="../WI_1.html"><em>Writing with Inform</em></a> and <a href="../RB_1.html"><em>The
Inform Recipe Book</em></a>, which can be found under the Documentation
tab in the Inform application. The online versions are of limited
use if you have the Inform application open, but they can be very handy
if you find yourself wanting to brush up on your Inform by reading on
your phone while riding on a train. Before getting too far along in the
process of writing a game, every Inform author should read the
Documentation! Several times, in fact. That’s the best way to get
familiar with the power of Inform.</p>

<p>Some aspiring authors, however, find the Documentation a bit
daunting. At times the Documentation seems to assume that a gentle nudge
in the right direction will be all that readers will need. Step-by-step
instructions, cross-references, and full discussions of the myriad
details that authors may need to have at their fingertips are not always
provided. Clearly, there’s room for a different approach.</p>

<p><em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> grew out of my experiences teaching
younger students (ages 10 through 15) to write interactive fiction using
Inform 7. When beginning students asked me how to do the kinds of things
that beginning authors naturally want to do, I sometimes found that the
information they needed was scattered through the Documentation, making
it hard to find and hard to put together into a clear mental picture.
Figuring out how to do some of the most basic real-world programming
chores strictly by reading the Documentation may take a bit of study.
I’ve heard comments about this from adult newcomers as well.</p>

<p>In <em>The Inform 7 Handbook,</em> information is organized into
chapters by task. Chapter 2 is about making rooms, Chapter 5 tells how
to create characters, Chapter 6 has ideas for designing puzzles, and so
on. None of the chapters is intended to tell you absolutely everything
about a given topic that you might want or need to know; after (or
while) reading a section of the <em>Handbook</em>, you’ll often want to
refer back the Documentation. I’ve included cross-references in many
places to show what pages you should consult.</p>

<p>Inform 7 is not the only programming language available for writing
interactive fiction. Its main competition (if free software can be said
to compete) comes from <a href="http://www.tads.org/">TADS 3</a>. Version 3 of TADS (The Adventure
Development System) is, in some ways, more sophisticated than Inform 7,
and Eric Eve’s marvelous alternate library for T3, which goes by the
name adv3Lite, streamlines some of the difficulties that make TADS
intimidating. adv3Lite borrows a few useful ideas from Inform 7, in
fact. Nonetheless, the TADS programming language is as different from I7
as night and day. TADS 3 closely resembles traditional programming
languages such as C. (If you don’t know what that means, don’t worry
about it.)</p>

<p>Inform, TADS, and a couple of other authoring systems trace their
ancestry directly back to <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=fft6pu91j85y4acv">Crowther &amp; Woods’ Adventure</a>, a
text-based game that ran, initially, on mainframe computers in the
1970s. Today this type of interaction is called <em>parser-based,</em>
because the reader/player types commands (such as GO NORTH or GET LAMP)
that are processed by an internal routine called a parser. More
recently, a very different type of interactive fiction, sometimes called
<em>choice-based,</em> has become popular. In a choice-based fiction,
the reader/player is relieved of the burden of having to think what
command to type; instead, the story presents a few links that can be
clicked or tapped to move matters forward. Inform can be used to produce
clickable choice-based interactive fiction, but you won’t find much
about that concept in this book, because I frankly don’t find
choice-based fiction very interesting. To me, the fictional world of an
interactive story is much more engaging when the reader/player has to
figure out what to do, rather than being presented with a cut-and-dried
menu of choices.</p>

<p>The “natural language” programming interface of I7 makes I7 very
attractive to those who would like to write interactive stories but have
no background in computer programming. Also, at this writing the TADS 3
development environment, Workbench, is a Windows-only application. TADS
games can be played on the Mac or on a Linux computer, but the slick
development tools are Windows-specific. For classroom use, Inform 7 is a
better choice not only because the “natural language” aspects of the
system may be easier for the newcomer to understand, but because it
makes no difference whether a given student uses a Macintosh, Windows,
or Linux computer.</p>

<p>Inform games can be located on websites and played within a Web
browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer using systems
called Parchment and Quixe. (Internet Explorer seems to be a poor choice
for running Parchment and Quixe, in my limited testing. This is probably
because Parchment and Quixe are written in Javascript, and Microsoft
uses a non-standard implementation of Javascript in IE.) When you’ve
finished writing your game, these tools will make it easier than ever
for you to share it with players and fans. In fact, Inform allows you to
release your game in the form of a web page, so it will be ready to go &ndash;
assuming you have a website to which you can upload it.</p>

<p>If neither the no-compromise complexity of TADS 3 nor the friendly
but sometimes fuzzy approach of Inform 7 appeals to you, you can also
investigate Inform 6, which is a completely different and much more
traditional programming language, although it shares the “Inform” name,
or a simpler system such as ADRIFT or ALAN. ALAN is cross-platform (Mac,
Windows, Linux); The application to create Adrift games is Windows-only, but the games are playable on other platforms.</p>

<p>A simpler option for writing interactive stories would be to use a
choice-based authoring system. Several are currently available,
including <a href="https://undum.com/">Undum</a>, <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a>,
and <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/">ChoiceScript</a>.
Choice-based stories are sometimes referred to as CYOA (choose your own
adventure), because their ancestry goes back to a flurry of CYOA
paperback books that was published in the 1970s. CYOA stories are not
puzzle-oriented, but some of the authoring systems are much easier to
use than Inform. (This is not true of Undum, by the way. Undum is quite
a lot harder to learn than Inform, but allows the author to do wonderful
effects.)</p>

<p>All of these systems, and others, are available for download on the
Web.</p>

<p>Like Inform itself, <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> is free. I hope
you find it useful. If there are areas where you feel it could be
expanded or improved, I hope you’ll fire off an email (good email
addresses are <a href="mailto:midiguru23@sbcglobal.net">midiguru23@sbcglobal.net</a> and <a href="mailto:editor@musicwords.net">editor@musicwords.net</a>) and
let me know what you’d like to see. Updated versions may be released
from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>Thanks go first and foremost to Graham Nelson for the monumental task
of creating, developing, and maintaining Inform. Emily Short is tireless
in her assistance and support for Inform authors. David Kinder maintains
the Windows IDE (Integrated Development Environment) software for Inform
7, and Andrew Hunter the MacOS IDE. Andrew Plotkin’s Glulx system allows
large games and games with extra features to be written in Inform;
without Glulx, Inform would be a much less attractive proposition for
game designers.</p>

<p>Like Inform itself, <em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> is a community
effort. Early drafts were read by Michael Callaghan, Eric Eve, Ron
Newcomb, Emily Short, Mike Tarbert, and Michael Neal Tenuis, all of whom
suggested valuable additions and clarifications. I also took advantage
of materials developed for other classes by Mark Engelberg and Jeff
Nyman. During the writing process, the experts on the <a href="https://intfiction.org">IntFiction forum</a> freely shared their knowledge with me; you’ll find their names
scattered throughout. I also cribbed a few questions posted on
IntFiction by novice programmers, and made free use of questions and
concerns raised by the students in my own IF classes.</p>

<p><em>The Inform 7 Handbook</em> was written using OpenOffice Writer,
which also handled the very nice cross-referencing and clickable table
of contents in the exported PDF.</p>

<p>Thanks to all!</p>
